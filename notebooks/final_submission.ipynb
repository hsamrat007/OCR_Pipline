The Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999 passed by the Indian Parliament on March 10, 1999 to amend the Patents Act of 1970 that provides for establishment of a mail box system to file patents and accords exclusive marketing rights for 5 years. 2. The Trade Marks Bill, 1999, which repeals and replaces the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 passed by the Indian Parliament in the Winter Session that concluded on December 23, 1999. The Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1999 passed by both houses of the Indian Parliament, and signed by the President of India on December 30, 1999. A sui generis legislation for the protection of geographical indications called the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Bill, 1999 approved by both houses of the Indian Parliament on December 23, 1999. The Industrial Designs Bill, 1999, which replaces the Designs Act, 1911 was passed in the Upper House of the Indian Parliament in the Winter Session, which concluded on December 23, 1999 and is presently before the Lower House for its consideration. The Patents (Second Amendment) Bill, 1999 to further amend the Patents Act, 1970 and make it TRIPS compliant was introduced in the Upper House of Indian Parliament on December 20, 1999. In addition to the above legislative changes, the Government of India has taken several measures to streamline and strengthen the intellectual property administration system in the country. The Trade Marks Registry is also proposed to be further strengthened and modernized. As regards the aspect enforcement, Indian enforcement agencies are now working very effectively and there has been a notable decline in the levels of piracy in India. Concerns expressed over IPR protection & India's response Q: India does not provide an effective patent protection in the pharmaceutical sector. India does provide for patents in the pharmaceutical sector. Currently the patents are restricted to the methods or process of manufacture and not extended to the substances/products themselves. Ill terms of the TRIPS Agreement, India has time till January 1, 2005 to extend patent protection to this area. The ten-year transition period available for providing product patents to pharmaceutical products is within WTO rules. Q: It has been further said that India has failed to meet its current obligations required under TRIPS Agreement for implementing appropriate, conforming mailbox and exclusive marketing rights procedures. The Government of India has taken the following steps to meet its obligations: 1. On December 31, 1994, Government of India promulgated an Ordinance to provide a means to receive product patent applications in the fields of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products and also for grant of exclusive marketing rights. Pursuant to this measure the Indian Patent Office has been receiving product patent applications in those fields. India has established a mailbox system through administrative instructions. Numerous applications have already been filed in this mailbox system, and many of them have been filed by US companies; 3.

CLINTON VISIT (Continued from page 1) economic, scientific and technological assistance that, among others, made the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s possible. The end of the Cold War in the 1990s, coinciding with the liberalization of the Indian economy, saw a steady improvement in India-US relations with the Clinton Administration identifying India as one of the 10 major emerging markets. The last few years have witnessed a number of high-level exchanges, unprecedented in the history of bilateral relations, as well as a commencement of a \"strategic dialogue\", which were expected to culminate in a US Presidential visit to India in 1998. The nuclear tests of May 1998 caused a temporary setback to the relationship. The US imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions under the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act (Glenn Amendment) besides terminating all forms of defense cooperation, including IMET. The US has, nonetheless, recognized the need to engage India in an effort to address its own concerns and to normalize relations. Following ten rounds of talks from June 1998 between External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, normalcy has been restored to the bilateral relationship, although some issues still remain to be resolved. President Clinton's forthcoming visit to India is an opportunity for both countries to build a new relationship between the world's two largest democracies in the 21st century based on their common strengths, values and interests. Bilateral trade between the two countries has exceeded US \\(\\$ 12\\) billion in 1999. There was a decline in FDI inflows from the US in 1998 (US \\(\\$ 349\\) million as against US \\(\\$ 719\\) million in 1997), which could be attributed not only to the impact of the economic sanctions on the general investment climate in India, but also to the South East Asian turmoil and the slowdown in the Indian economy. There was an upward trend in 1999, with FDI inflows in the first four months of the year itself amounting to US\\$ 186 million. The waiver of sanctions and the opening up of the insurance sector in India are likely to further increase FDI inflows into India in the near future. Some of the areas in which the two countries are well placed to launch a new era of cooperation are science and technology, energy, environment, infrastructure development and information technology. Apart from the two governments, cooperation is also being intensified between professional societies and business and trade representatives of the two countries.

India's nuclear forces will be effective, enduring, diverse, flexible, and responsive to the requirements in accordance with the concept of credible minimum deterrence. These forces will be based on a triad of aircraft, mobile land-based missiles and sea-based assets in keeping with the objectives outlined above. Survivability of the forces will be enhanced by a combination of multiple redundant systems, mobility, dispersion and deception. The doctrine envisages assured capability to shift from peacetime deployment to fully employable forces in the shortest possible time, and the ability to retaliate effectively even in a case of significant degradation by hostile strikes. Credibility and Survivability The following principles are central to India's nuclear deterrent 4.1. Credibility: Any adversary must know that India can and will retaliate with sufficient nuclear weapons to inflict destruction and punishment that the aggressor will find unacceptable if nuclear weapons are used against India and its forces. Effectiveness: The efficacy of India's nuclear deterrent be maximised through synergy among all elements involving reliability, timeliness, accuracy and weight of the attack. 4.3 Survivability: (i) India's nuclear forces and their command and control shall be organised for very high survivability against surprise attacks and for rapid punitive response. They shall be designed and deployed to ensure survival against a first strike and to endure repetitive attrition attempts with adequate retaliatory capabilities for a punishing strike which would be unacceptable to the aggressor. Procedures for the continuity of nuclear command and control shall ensure a continuing capability to effectively employ nuclear weapons. Command and Control 5.1. Nuclear weapons shall be tightly controlled and released for use at the highest political level, the authority to release nuclear weapons for use resides in the person of the Prime Minister of India, or the designated successor(s). An effective and survivable command and control system with requisite flexibility and responsiveness shall be in place. An integrated operational plan, or a series of sequential plans, predicated on strategic objectives and a targeting policy shall form part of the system. For effective employment the unity of command and control of nuclear forces including dual capable delivery systems shall be ensured. The survivability of the nuclear arsenal and effective command, control, communications, computing, intelligence and information (C4I2) systems shall be assured. The Indian defence forces shall be in a position to, execute operations in an NBC environment with minimal degradation; Space based and other assets shall be created to provide early warning, communications, damage/detonation assessment. Security and Safety 6.1. Security: Extraordinary precautions shall be taken to ensure that nuclear weapons, their manufacture, transportation and storage are fully guarded against possible theft, loss, sabotage, damage or unauthorised access or use. Safety is an absolute requirement and tamper proof procedures and systems shall be instituted to ensure that unauthorised or inadvertent activation/use of nuclear weapons does not take place and risks of accident are avoided.

India does not want an arms race: External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh India's Minister of External Affairs Jaswant Singh said India has no intention of engaging in any arms race. He added that India only wants to maintain a credible deterrent nuclear defense capability. Mr. Jaswant Singh, gave the reassurance in his speech on \"India and ASEAN: Security Paradigms for AD 2000\" organized by the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies during his visit to Singapore. India plays a strategic role in regional stability, asserted Mr. Jaswant Singh, but it does not pose a threat to its neighbors. \"India has neither been, nor has it been perceived to be \"hegemonic\". It has never exported any disturbing or destabilizing ideology. It has not sought to conquer or even covet others territory, it has not sought to dominate through trade,\" the Indian Minister told his audience at the meeting. \"But India does seek to increase its economic engagement with the rest of the world. It is vital, therefore, to ensure peace and stability on the region. India's borders and in the regions with which it has increased interactions\". \"Today, we are ASEAN's geographical neighbors with greater interactions on economic, political and security interests than ever before. The engagement of a militarily stronger, economically prosperous, democratic and secular India imparts greater stability to the region,\" he said. On India's bilateral dispute with Pakistan, Mr. Jaswant Singh said the issue could be addressed through dialogue. But he noted that an \"environment conducive for dialogue requires that you stop promoting crossborder terrorism, advocating jihad as an instrument of foreign policy\". Mr. Jaswant Singh said establishing and managing a stable, tolerant and secular state is a common problem faced by many countries in the region. It is also an issue that can be complicated by externally induced factors. He said the goal is to forge a common endeavor to create political stability and security in the region. Indian Science Delegation in Washington Dr. R.A. Mashelkar, Secretary, Government of India, Scientific & Industrial Research and Director General, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, addressed Washington based science diplomats of different countries tries at a function organized at the Indian embassy today. Dr. Mashelkar emphasized India's tremendous competitive advantages in facing the challenges of the new century, which could turn it into a global R&D center. By the year 2015, 55% of India's population will be under 20 years age giving India a large human resource pool of 600 to 700 million young adults. This would in turn provide a tremendous cost advantage to India's R&D giving it the highest return on investment in knowledge industries.

Wired to the World Leveraging Power Through IT According to the recently released NASSCOM-McKinsey Study on Indian IT strategies, Indian and India-centric companies have opportunities in four broad areas - value-added IT services, software products, IT-enabled services and e-business. The report suggests that by the year 2008, software and services will contribute over 7.5 per cent of the overall GDP growth of India; exports in the IT sector will attract foreign direct investment (FDI) of $4-5 billion; and the overall revenues from the IT sector will be nearly $90 billion including $50 billion in exports. The IT task force is trying to radically enhance per capita productivity of software engineers in India from $15,000-$40,000 at present, to over $1,50,000 which will be com- parable to those in the US and Israel. Moreover, if India can shift State of Maryland passes resolutions congratulating India on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Indian Republic Washington, DC March 28, 2000 The Maryland House of Delegates and the Senate of Maryland approved separate Resolutions yesterday, congratulating the Government of India on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Indian Republic. The House Resolution, sponsored by Delegate Kumar P. Barve, \"offers its sincerest congratulations to the Republic of India in recognition of its Golden Anniversary and as an expression of our true admiration and great respect for the largest democracy in the world\". The Senate Resolution, sponsored by the President and all Mem- bers, \"offers its sincerest congratulations to the Republic of India in recognition of its Golden Anniversary celebrating 50 years of dem- ocracy\". The Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate presented the Resolutions to the Indian Charge d'Affaires, Mr. T.P. Sreenivasan at separate ceremonies at the State House. Responding to the Reso- lutions, Mr. Sreenivasan said that India felt greatly honoured that the House of Delegates and the Senate of Maryland had approved congratulatory Resolutions on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Indian Republic. He noted that the Indian Constitution, adopted 50 years ago, was inspired by the ideals and aspirations of the US Constitution. He also said that the honour came to India at a historic moment when a new chapter in Indo-US relations was opened by the historic and highly successful visit India by President Clinton. The Delegates and the Senators gave India a standing ovation at the end of the ceremony. Earlier, several Delegates and Senators attended a reception hosted by the Charge d'Affaires in the Silver Room of the State House. The focus of its software exports from the low-end to the high-end, then India can be a $100 billion player in the IT world by 2008. By Akshay Joshi Times of India May 24, 2000 Underestimating India The situation in southern Asia among the three nuclear weapon powers (China, India and Pakistan) is very different and the present era is different from the Cold War era. Of the three, only India is an open society and a democracy. The other two countries are in a position to keep their nuclear strategy and posture concealed from their public. India has also proclaimed a no-first-use policy and that makes it all the more important that it should be in a position to project deterrence in a credible manner. That exercise involves both the capability and the will to retaliate. One of the problems in- dia faces in relation to Pakistan is the perception among the politico- strategic elite of the latter about India's lack of will to sustain a war. In these circumstances, it is essential that India should demon- strate in a non-provocative man- ner its deterrent capability. A mini- mum deterrent should demonstrate its credibility through the command and control system and the overt and publicised involvement of the armed forces. By K.

Under the agreement, both the NIH and ICMR are the primary funders of biomedical research in their respective countries and support a wide variety of relevant researches. The institutions have agreed to convene on a regular basis to consider and facilitate proposals for cooperation. They will also provide technical advice to each other's scientists and government officials. Specific areas to be addressed within this program include: Prevention and treatment of leading causes of maternal, neonatal and pediatric morbidity and mortality (including toxemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, birth asphyxia and trauma, accidents, diarrhea and other infectious diseases, etc.): Prevention and treatment of low birth weight and intrauterine growth retardation; Maternal and child nutrition and the role of micronutrients in healthy child bearing and pediatric and adolescent health and development; Birth defects, genetic disorders and development research; Improved understanding of pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in women and children including childhood asthma, acute respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, reproductive tract infections and malignancies and HIV/AIDS; Reproductive health including socio-behavioral aspects, birth practices and development and evaluation of newer contracep- tives; Traditional systems of medicine and practices which have an important impact on the health and well-being of women and children adolescents; Emergency obstetric care for miscarriages and other problems of pregnancy, including severe preeclampsia, hemorrhage and embolism; Relationship between maternal; nutrition, fetal growth/development and degenerative diseases in later life; and Analysis, consensus building and policy formulation on public health benefits and cost-effectiveness of new approaches to improve maternal and child health. National Initiative for Child Protection (NICP) Mrs. Maneka Gandhi, Minister for Social Justice & Empowerment, launched the National Initiative for Child Protection (NICP) on June 27, 2000 with an aim to spread better and greater understanding of the special needs of children and placing child's rights and protection on the National Agenda. The broad goal of the NICP is to build partnerships with the allied systems like the police system, the health care system, the judicial system and the education system etc. The NICP is a campaign, which seeks to place child's rights and child protection on the agenda of all the allied systems such as the police, the health care center, and the transport departments and labe departments etc. A greater understanding of the special needs of children in need of care and protection will result in several positive things like greater access to services such as health care, education, justice, etc. For children, development of specialized services for children where they are needed, allocation of resources for children including time, attention, money, infrastructure etc. And an attitudinal change in perceiving the problems of the child and in dealing with them. To make the NICP successful a national core group has been formed for wider consultation and training of trainers is being organized at the regional level. Preparation of source material is on the way. The States have been asked to lend their support in this gigantic task. Training systems have been evolved for the allied systems like police etc. And child protection issues are being integrated into the curriculum of training institutes. In its first phase, the NICP will be implementing in 14 cities across the country through a network of NGOs. <OCR/> U.S. and India Pledge (Continued from page the National Institute Abuse; Fogarty and pediatric (including Reproductive health including Disease and evaluation tives; Agency Development. and ICMR systems medi- and nutrition the child bearing and and other hemor- Specific areas this be addressed and causes maternal, building and nal and child health.

PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS from page 9 Our National Income has grown by 6 percent; Having crossed 200 million tonnes, production of foodgrains is higher today than ever before; Food stocks are higher today than ever. For this our kisans deserve our felicitations. Our agricultural scientists are also worthy of our praise. Industrial production is reviving at an energetic pace; The new initiatives which have been taken in infrastructure have infused a new purposefulness right across the economy; At over 30 billion dollars our foreign exchange reserves are higher than ever before; The Sensex in the stock market has risen to record levels. In spite of Kargil, our companies have been able to increase their market value by over Rs. 200,000 crore. The off-take of cement for building houses is 22 percent higher than it has ever been; Facilities which were known only to the rich, to the few, and in our cities alone - insurance for their output, credit cards - are now available to, and are being taken advantage of by farmers and by others in our far-flung villages. And we are stronger than ever. Pokharan has given us enviable strength and self-confidence. AGNI-2 has been tested - in the face of pressures - and will be integrated into our defence arsenal. PSLV and INSAT 2-E have been launched. What a feat our scientists have accomplished: sending not just one, but three satellites on a single rocket far out into space, and placing each of them at the precise point in space, which had been fixed. This has been a magnificent achievement. Yes, one thing has certainly come down. It is the rate of inflation. At 1.3 percent, this is the lowest rate in seventeen years. There has also been a sea change in the way the world sees us. Last year we had taken a major step - Pokharan-2 - which was essential for our security, a step which had been contemplated for long but which could take a long time because of the pres- sures which were put on successive governments. Some did not agree with our assessment. Some even sought to portray us as an irresponsible nation. However today, within a year in the country, India is synonymous with responsibility. The world has seen that we will protect our national interest at all costs: whether it is in developing an atomic weapons capability, whether it is in developing an ing missile-capability, whether it is in developing series out of our laity, whether it is in developing an es that are intended to keep us from taking the measures that we consider necessary in our national interest; Also the world has seen that whatever we will do will be for self-defence, never for aggression. But the world has also seen that we are capable of doing so with utmost restraint, with utmost responsibility. These were the principles, which guided us when Pakistan forced the Kargil war on us. Our response was well-thought out. It was so effective that it left the enemy stunned. The world today has well realized that we would do whatever is required to protect our country. The world has also understood that we would act with utmost responsibility and restraint even when so gravely provoked. This has raised the reputation of India in the international community. The Lahore bus journey was taken to improve our relations with Pakistan. This made the world realize that we truly want peace and friendship. This journey was not a showpiece. It was a serious and well-con sidered move, which we made knowing fully well that there could be risks in it. Our honesty made an impact on the international community. Later, when the bus to Lahore was taken to Kargil, it did not take much time for the world to realize that Pakistan not only violated the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration, but it also crossed the borders of trust and goodwill. That is what turned the world's opinion. Pakistan stood completely isolated on the world stage. India received widespread support in the world for the first time. I do hope that the people of Pakistan too will reflect on these events. We reached out to you with a message of friendship. What did we gain in return? Hun- dreds lost their lives. Relations were spoilt. The resources which ought to have been used for economic and social development were instead spent on war. We need peace in order to raise the standard of living of the people in both countries. For peace, we need trust. Harsh K. Khare, who pleased on account of all that hap- lead to friendship? Terrorists are being trained in Pakistan. Camps are being run for them. Hordes of terrorists are being sent into India. They are killing innocent people. They are targeting women and children. How can- ingful dialogue take place in this atmosphere? Pakistan must realize that no problem can be resolved if it continues to promote terrorist activities. We must let the evil designs of terrorists be van- Today, Punjab is free of terrorism. The people of Jammu and Kashmir are fed up with\n"

Visit of INS Mysore INS Mysore, an Indian Navy guided missile destroyer, participated in the International Naval Review on July 4, 2000 in New York. A ship of the U.S. Navy and 20 other countries participated in this event and was reviewed by the U.S. President Bill Clinton.

INS Mysore is the second Indian Naval Ship, which has been christened as MYSORE. The old INS Mysore, a Cruiser, began her life in the Royal Navy as HMS Nigeria on 3rd August 1940. During the Second World War she distinguished herself in various theatres of war from the icy waters of the Arctic to the coral reefs of South East Asia. The ship was transferred to the Indian Navy on 29th August 1957. Her advent symbolised power. Her main armament of 6\" guns could deliver a fusillade of 2.5 tons of explosives a minute on the enemy. Mysore's first adventure in her chequered career was the liberation of Goa in 1961. Her tasks included the speedy capture of Anjadip, neutralisation and capture of the Portuguese frigate Aphonso de Albuquerque, and subsequent administration of the territory. In 1965 Mysore led the Fleet for two sorties in the North East Arabian Sea and off North Saurashtra, but the enemy did not seek action. It fell once again on Mysore to lead the Western Fleet to victory in December 1971, achieving a most effective blockade of Karachi and virtual command of the Arabian Sea. In her twilight years, Mysore served as the Cadets Training Cruiser, the very cradle of professionalism through which many a future officer passed.

India not to engage in a nuclear arms race: Jaswant Singh, external affairs minister You have been engaged in extended talks with the U.S. since the nuclear tests last year. How would you assess the results so far? First, by restating the objectives from our side. They are two-fold: in the first place, to reconcile the stated U.S. non-proliferation concerns with India's national security objectives; secondly, and, in a greater mutual understanding so that both countries are enabled to work together in tapping the real potential of a qualitatively new relationship, essential in this post-Cold War environment. The results of my discussions with Mr. Strobe Talbott are encouraging. There is recognition that India shall maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent as determined by us. There is now no longer any talk of a 'roll-back'. The U.S. also accepts that India's security concerns are not geographically limited. Foreign policy tasks and challenges are a continuing process, therefore, we need to consolidate these understandings across all sections that make up the U.S. foreign policy establishment. Do you have a timeframe for concluding this dialogue? In the management of foreign policy, deadlines are both impractical and unrealistic. But if we manage through the objectives, then the first part is the restoration of our relationship to the pre-May 1998 position.

PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS (Continued from page 2) One of our immediate tasks will be to firmly put down terrorism, which has come to cast its cruel shadow on innocent people. Our message is loud and clear: The life of every India citizen under our dispensation is precious. In our fight against terrorism, we will be guided by the principle of 'Zero Tolerance'. The same principle of 'Zero Tolerance' will apply while dealing with corruption that has bred contempt for the law. One of the first legislations we will take up is the Lokpal Bill so that the rot can be checked from the top. A broad consensus already exists on electoral reforms to weed out muscle and money power. We propose to soon introduce in Parliament a comprehensive electoral reform Bill. We often talk of the future belonging to our youth. But, for decades their problems, especially that of unemployment, have remain unattended. We believe that our young women and men will be the architects of the 'new' India of the 21st century. I am confident that a buoyant national economy will create tremendous employment opportunities. I am equally confident that our focus on education and health will prepare today's youth for tomorrow's challenges. The Government of free India had set itself the noble task of wiping every tear from every eye, of ending centuries-old discriminations and social inequities. Somewhere along the journey from freedom to the eve of this century, Government lost track of that task. Illiteracy is a curse and a denial of human dignity. As is gender discrimination or, for that matter, lack of something as basic and essential as drinking water and primary health care. My dear countrymen, India today needs a Government that cares; India needs a Government that will reach out to the last person in the last row. Our Government pledges itself to narrowing the gap between our performance and your expectation. The Mandate of '99 is a bond of trust between people and Government. We shall not betray this trust. With the help of a billion people proud of being Indian, There is nothing that we cannot achieve; No problem we cannot tackle; No challenge we cannot face; and, No opportunity we cannot seize.

All of you are familiar with the saying \"Karela Aur Neem Chadha\" (The bitterness of Karela is further worsened by adding to it the bitterness of Neem.) In our case, over thirty five thousand of our people have been killed by terrorists. Terrorism has become a big problem in many other parts of the world, too. It is obstructing the path of peace and development. Today, there is a need to mobilize world opinion against terrorism. Today, on the occasion of Independence Day, India stands with full self-confidence. Our gaze is turned to the future. Our standing in the world has risen. Now, the people are not attracted by the controversies and narrow disputes of yesterday. Throughout the war in Kargil, I was specially satisfied by two features. There was no communal tension anywhere in the country. Goodwill and brotherhood prevailed everywhere, including in Jammu and Kashmir. This must have despaired those who thought that riots would break out in India as soon as the spark of war is lit. Those who hatched the conspiracy of strife, must have been truly disillusioned. The people of all sections of society worked for India's success in the war. A powerful wave of patriotism traveled everywhere. When I went to Kargil and met our jawans, I saw our entire country there: soldiers from Nagaland, from Assam, from Tamil Nadu, from almost every state were fighting for the country. There was not the slightest distance between them on account of caste or religion or region. This is the real India. We must make their oneness our own. We have to live for this India. We have to work for this India. And, if necessary, we have to lay down our lives for this India, as our brave jawans did. Kargil has once again shown that whenever our patriotism is aroused, all of us stand as one with full confidence and determination, as a fist clenched in conviction. We face our challenges unitedly. Our adversaries should beware of this. At the same time, there is an equally important lesson for us. Now that the crisis has been beaten back, do not unclench this fist of unity. The battle is not over. New challenges are knocking at our doors. The patriotism that coursed through the veins of Indians should be made a permanent feature of our lives. All of us remember the talisman Gandhiji gave us: when in doubt about what to do, he taught us, think of the least, of the most helpless man you have seen, ask yourself, \"Will this step be in his interest?\" he said, and you will see all your doubts melt away. Kargil gives us a second talisman: As we contemplate a step, let us ask ourselves: \"is it worthy of the soldier who gave his life on those mountains? Does the impulse which lies behind it measure up to the spirit which filled that soldier as he fought to protect our Motherland?\" The challenges that confront us cannot be overcome only by the men on the frontiers doing their duty. There is a need for an organized and disciplined nation to stand behind them. We must defend our country and develop our society by keeping national interests utmost in our minds. If our economy is not strong, and if we are not self-reliant in important matters of national security, then we cannot successfully face external challenges. All of us, wherever we may be, whatever work we may be doing, we should discharge our responsibilities well. We must never allow any limb of our nation or society to become weak. It is clear from the effective way in which we have overcome our challenges and dealt with our difficulties, that we can do anything if we resolve to do it. What is needed is to take a pledge: that whatever we can do, we will now do. I have a vision of India: an India free of hunger and fear, an India free of illiteracy and want. I dream of an India that is prosperous, strong and caring. An India, that regains a place of honour in the comity of great nations. Come, let us build an India in which we have balanced development that benefits all regions and all sections of society. I note with regret that several regions in the country - including the North-Eastern States - have been the victims of unbalanced progress. The nation has an especially pressing obligation to bring the people of the North-East into the development mainstream. Come, let us build an India in which Dalits, Adivasis, and Backward Classes are not only freed from economic deprivation, but also enjoy the fruits of social justice. The path that will take us to this ideal is the path of samata, mamata, and samajik samarasata. Come, let us build an India in which our nari shakti - our women - are able to realize its full potential bringing the future of the nation. It is our collective responsibility to empower them\n"

Excerpts from U.S. news media on Prime Minister Vajpayee's visit A \"Tilt\" towards India Two years ago, India's nuclear tests provoked worldwide condemnation and retaliatory sanctions by the United States. Yet in recent months, culminating in Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's visit to Washington last weekend, the United States has drawn closer to India diplomatically than at any time since the early 1960's. President Clinton has shaped a new foreign policy course in South Asia by embracing India and distancing the United States from Pakistan's military government. These steps have far-reaching ramifications for all of Asia, including China, as well as for the issue of nuclear proliferation. The shift is justified by India's growing importance. Editorial, New York Times - September 20, 2000 Vajpayee's After Dedication Speech (Continued from page 9) It has taken a very short time - from March to September - for our two countries to come a long way. At the same time, it seems that New Delhi and Washington are not a long way off from each other. I describe this period as \"Six Months That Cemented the Natural Alliance Between India and America\". The Vision Document we signed in New Delhi has been translated into a specific forward movement in a number of areas in the Joint Statement adopted in Washington. It reflects the synergy of our manual interests. We have laid a solid foundation for stronger and more broad-based economic cooperation between our two countries. I am confident that this foundation will support the attractive architecture of Indo- American relations in the coming years. But going beyond the mutuality of economic opportunities, our two sides have talked candidly about several important issues that form the texture of our bilateral relations. At This Dinner, Harmony Is Served India and America clinked glasses in their new whirlwind friendship at an elaborate and exotic state dinner at the White House last night as Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee profusely praised Bill and Hillary Clinton-and also Christopher Columbus, \"who set sail for India but landed in America. I wonder where we would be if he had actually reached India.\" The line got a big laugh from the nearly 700 assorted political, business and entertainment glitterati lucky enough to snag one of the coveted seats in what was by far the largest-and possibly last-such event of the Clinton administration. Continued on next page We have talked about security matters. We have talked about the situation in South Asia. We have also talked about threat of terrorism to civilized world order. Of course, differences are bound to be there between the two countries. But dialogue between democracies, in an atmosphere of candour and trust, never fails to dissolve some if not all differences. And that is what has happened on account of the continuing dialogue at various levels between our two democracies. From divergence, we have moved to a convergence of thinking and outlook on a broad range of issues. I heartily thank all those who have contributed to the success of this dialogue. I especially applaud the consistent efforts of the Indian-American community. Your patience and hard work are paying off. Keep it up. I thank all of you for the opportunity of sharing my thoughts with you.

Well-known international trademarks have been protected in India even when they were not registered in India. Computer software companies have successfully curtailed piracy through court orders. Computer databases have been protected. The courts, under the doctrine of breach of confidentiality, accorded an extensive protection of trade secrets. Right to privacy, which is not protected even in some developed countries, has been recognized in India. Protection of intellectual property rights in India continues to be strengthened further. The year 1999 witnessed the consideration and passage of major legislation with regard to protection of intellectual property rights in harmony with international practices and in compliance with India's obligations under Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). These include: 1. The Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999 passed by the Indian Parliament on March 10, 1999 to amend the Patents Act of 1970 that provides for establishment of a mail box system to file patents and accords exclusive marketing rights for 5 years. The Trade Marks Bill, 1999, which repeals and replaces the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 passed by the Indian Parliament in the Winter Session that concluded on December 23, 1999. The Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1999 passed by both houses of the Indian Parliament, and signed by the President of India on December 30, 1999. A sui generis legislation for the protection of geographical indications called the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Bill, 1999 approved by both houses of the Indian Parliament on December 23, 1999. The Industrial Designs Bill, 1999, which replaces the Designs Act, 1911 was passed in the Upper House of the Indian Parliament in the Winter Session, which concluded on December 23, 1999 and is presently before the Lower House for its consideration. The Patents (Second Amendment) Bill, 1999 to further amend the Patents Act, 1970 and make it TRIPS compliant was introduced in the Upper House of Indian Parliament on December 20, 1999.

Prime Minister Vajpayee's Independence Day address to the Nation Sisters, Brothers and Dear Children, Accept my greetings on the sacred occasion of Independence Day. This is a day of hallowed remembrance for us. This is a day of dedication for us. This year's Independence Day has special significance for all of us. The present century is coming to an end. The world will have entered the next century by the time of the next Independence Day. As we stand at the sunset of the 20th century, and look back at the end of the era that has passed, we see the end of colonialism from Indian soil to be the most important development. Our great leaders, and many generations of our countrymen, waged a powerful struggle for independence. By doing so, they paved the way for the independence of other countries, too. We pay our homage to those self-sacrificing and devoted leaders and patriots who struggled for freedom throughout their lives, and, when necessary, even laid down their lives as aahuti (offering) in the great yagya of freedom. Come, all my countrymen, let us strive to become worthy heirs to those great leaders. We dedicate today's sacred day to their memory. In the same way, I offer my condolences to the valiant jawans, officers and others belonging to the Army and the Air Force, who displayed magnificent heroism and the spirit of sacrifice in recapturing that part of our Motherland in Kargil from the enemy. All of us bow our heads in gratitude for those who were martyred in the Kargil war. Almost all our countrymen have seen on television glimpses of the impossible summits, which our heroes overcame and pushed out the enemy. To gain victory at such heights is not only to surmount the sky-piercing peaks, it displays the full might of the nation. It is a symbol of the bravery of our Armed Forces. How can we forget such heroes? How can we forget those wounded soldiers whose only wish was: how fast can we get well and rejoin our battalion to repulse the enemy? How can we forget the members of the families of those brave martyrs, who, on receiving the body of their beloved, said, \"We do not have tears in our eyes, we have pride in our heart\"? How can we forget the mother whose lament was that she had had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son, there was that she had only one son,\n"

India.com goes Global Excerpts from an article written by Dewang Mehta, Director, National Association of Software and Service Companies The Indian software industry has zoomed from a mere $20 million ten years ago to a whopping US $3.9 billion in 1998-99. No industry has done as much for the competitive- ness of global corporations and, cer- tainly, no industry has created as many millionaires in India in such a short span of time. In 1998-99, 203 out of the Fortune 500 outsourced their software requirements from In dia. And US customers bought 61 percent of the software that Indian companies exported to 91 countries around the world. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, by picking the Indian city of Hyderabad to house his company's first-ever de velopment center outside the US, has already paid the ultimate tribute to the skill-base of the industry. Internet and E-Commerce Industry experts believe that once the Internet - although there are just about 1.4 million users today, has the potential to explode to 37 million once Net connections are available on cable-spreads across India, and will position India as a global hub for content development and e-commerce. Currently, more than 437 of Indian software houses provide web based applications and services. That the Internet is becoming an integral part of the Indian soft- ware business is also evident from its use alongside that of high-speed satellite connectivity for software de velopment and delivery. The delivery through high-speed connectiv- ity has been a successful factor for globalization of the Indian software industry.

India and US sign pact for lifting Quantitative Restrictions After months of negotiations India and US inked an agreement for a 15- month phase-out of import curbs between the two countries. Announc- ing this U.S. Trade Representatives Charlene Barshefsky said that tariff restrictions on half of the 1400 odd India still maintained on imports from U.S. would be lifted by April 1, 2000. On the remaining 714 items India would lift the import curbs by April 1, 2001, She said adding items on which India maintained import restric- tions included agriculture and textile items. India had originally maintained what has come to be known as quan- titative restrictions on imports from the United States in as many as 2,700 items. As per the WTO agreement India had to phase out these import curbs and it had so far dismantled it on over 1,300 items. The curbs were main- tained for balance of payments pur- poses. On the phase-out of the remaining 1429 tariff lines, there was a dispute between India and US over the phase out time schedule. With the rejection of New Delhi's plea by the WTO appellate panel in Septem- ber last, the two countries concluded the bilateral agreement here recently.

Note on Violation of India's airspace by Pakistan's Atlantique aircraft and consequent action On August 10, 1999, a Pakistani Naval Anti-Submarine Warfare and maritime reconnaissance aircraft, called Atlantique intruded 10 Kms into Indian Territory in the Area of KORI CREEK. The intruding aircraft was detected by IAF ground radars and was intercepted 10 Kms south of the International Border. When the IAF fighters closed in to identify and signal the intruding Pakistani aircraft to force it to land at an Indian base, the Pakistani aircraft acted in a hostile manner by turning into our fighter. At that stage the Atlantique was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a MIG-21 of the IAF, which hit the aircraft on the port engine which caught fire. Following is a comprehensive note on the incident: Intruding aircraft was of the Atlantique type. It is well-known to defence forces, especially navy/air forces all over the world, that this is an advanced military aircraft with following essential capabilities: The aircraft can not only carry out marine reconnaissance but also do surveillance / aerial photography and electronic intelligence gathering. Can carry a substantial weapons load (3.5 tonnes in the case of Pakistan version). This includes bombs, air-to-surface missiles and weapons meant for anti-ship and anti-submarine role, as well as air-to-air missiles. Pak military aircraft came well into Indian air space (up to 10 km). This was clearly a deep intrusion and violation of our air space in contravention of universally accepted norms of conduct in bilateral relation. This intrusion was also a blatant violation of the 1991 Agreement between India and Pakistan on Prevention of Air Space Violations and for permitting over flights and landings by military aircraft. The crucial provision in this Agreement is that air- craft of this type will not fly within 10 kms of each other's air space, except by prior permission. Pakistan neither informed us nor sought prior permission as required by the Agreement. Details of intrusions, aircraft type (as described above), mode of activity including movements of the aircraft, and its conduct after it was engaged by our air force, Pakistan's own statements thereafter make it clear beyond doubt that this was in no way a case of an innocent entry or straying into Indian air space, but a deliberate, planned operation for surveillance, space and intelligence gathering, using a sophisticated reconnaissance/combat aircraft for this purpose. It is crucial to recognise that surveillance / recon- naissance / intelligence gathering is an offensive military operation and a hostile activity. It cannot be passed off as harmless. The central issue therefore is not whether Pakistan aircraft was \"armed\" or \"unarmed\". The issue is that it was a military aircraft engaged in offensive and hostile military operation compounded by its combat capabilities. Pak Information Minister was quoted by BBC, soon after the incident, as stating that the aircraft was on a \"surveillance mission\". Subsequently, the Pak Gov- ernment spokesman stated that it was on a training mission. Following points are relevant in this connection: A genuine, routine training mission would never operate in sensitive border areas, leave alone violate the air space of a neighbouring country espe- cially at a time of tension. This is precisely what the Pak aircraft was doing. If the aircraft was flying out towards the high seas on a genuine mission, it could have traversed a more westward route away from the sensitive border areas If it was on a training mission, this would have to be linked with maritime reconnaissance. It was operating over a land area - covering part of our territory. The aircraft was at a height of 5,000-10,000 feet. This is an unusually low height for an aircraft supposedly on a training mission. Low attitude is, however, essential for carrying out photography of ground features. Area over which the Atlantique was executing its manoeuvres, is a sensitive border area and it has many ingress and egress routes. The indication is that the aircraft was engaged in reconnaissance, photography and surveillance over these features, as well as of ground activity on the Sir Creek area. Though the intrusion was not in this area, the fur- ther, the intrusion was not in this area, the fur- ther, there are a number of sensitive defence instal- lations and major civilian (industrial and scientific) areas near the area of intrusion, and further beyond the western sea coast of India. The aircraft intruded four times into Indian air space. After first entry, it carried out a circular movement, exited, entered again making another circular movement, it was after the fourth return into Indian territory, that it was encountered and engaged. <OCR/> Note on Violation of India's airspace by Pakistan's Atlantique aircraft and consequent action August 10, 1999, Pakistani Naval Anti-Subma- Kms KORI Indian crucial intruding aircraft detected recognise that surveillance recon- offensive hostile activity. cannot central therefore whether Pakistan that aircraft operation note the incident: quoted soon\n"

The joint initiatives and understandings that we reached represent a major step forward. India and the United States can be natural allies in the 21st century. Events and circumstances over the last two years have confirmed this.\\n\\nWe are both motivated by shared values that give freedom, dignity, democracy and tolerance the highest priority. Open societies oppose international terrorism which, in the cloak of religious extremism, is eating away at the foundation of democratic nations.\\n\\nThe integrity of nation-states as building blocks of a stable international order is threatened by newly-promoted concepts of interventionism that add to insecurity and social chaos. The principle of social equity that must underline economic prosperity and globalisation is often ignored. Barriers to mutually enriching science and technology must be removed to promote creativity and knowledge to the full.\\n\\nAs the two biggest open societies, India and the United States must address these pressing concerns. Agreement and common action would be ideal; but disagreement on some issues should not constitute division. We have agreed that, as our dialogue proceeds, we will listen with respect to each other and seek to accommodate our mutual concerns.\\n\\nAs natural allies, it is important that India and the United States remain engaged. Contacts should be so frequent that they become routine. President Bill Clinton\\'s visit to India in March took place after a gap of 22 years. In the fast-changing world in which we live, even 22 months is an unacceptable interruption.\\n\\nIndia is growing at an annual rate of more than 6 per cent; we aim to reach 9 per cent and beyond. Such growth results from unshackling the energy and enterprise of the Indian people. India is a vast market as well as an expanding platform for manufacture and services. Its growth has generated an insatiable thirst for green energy, efficient communications and modern infrastructure. India is open for business and partnership.\\n\\nIndia is in the vanguard of the knowledge revolution. Information technology and knowledge-intensive industries, including biotechnology, entertainment, communications and services, have taken root. They are now moving beyond India to network at a global level. Traditional industry and science also continue to flourish. India today is equally adept in both \"brick\" and \"click\" economies.\\n\\nNo armies from India have stepped out to conquer and dominate others. We want a world free of weapons of mass destruction. But security in the real world must be based on the principle of equal security for all. Without a non-discriminatory world order, our experience has taught us that peace lies in strength. The security of one billion Indians is central to Asia\\'s security and stability. Yet peace and strength are not incompatible. As a nuclear weapon state, our approach is guided by a sense of responsibility and transparency that we urge others to adopt.\\n\\nA unilateral moratorium on explosive tests, a policy of \"no first use,\" a tight export control regime and a willingness to engage with other countries on all aspects of international security are the principles of India\\'s nuclear policy.'}]}]}\n"

      "At over 30 billion dollars our foreign exchange reserves are higher than ever before;\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sensex in the stock market has risen to record levels. In spite of Kargil, our companies have been able to increase their market value by over Rs. 200,000 crore.\n",

      "The off-take of cement for building houses is 22 percent higher than it has ever been;\n",

      "Facilities which were known only to the rich, to the few, and in our cities alone --- insurance for the output, credit cards --- are now available to, and are being taken advantage of by farmers and by others in our far-flung villages.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we are stronger than ever. Pokharan has given us enviable strength and self-confidence. ADNI-2 has been tested --- in the face of pressures --- and will be integrated into our defence arsenal.\n",
      "\n",
      "PSLV and INSAT 2-E have been launched. What a feat our scientists have accomplished: sending not just one, but three satellites on a single rocket far out into space, and placing each of them at the precise point in space, which had been fixed. This has been a magnificent achievement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, one thing has certainly come down. It is the rate of inflation. At 1.3 percent, this is the lowest rate in seventeen years.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has also been a sea change in the way the world sees us. Last year we had taken a major step --- Pokharan-2 --- which was essential for our security, a step which had been contemplated for long but which could not be taken because of the pressures which were put on successive governments.\n",
      "\n",

      "The world has seen that we will withstand all pressures that are intended to keep us from taking measures that we consider necessary in our national interest;\n",

      "Our honesty made an impact on the international community. Later, when the bus to Lahore was taken to Kargil, it did not take much time for the world to realize that Pakistan not only violated the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration, but it also crossed the borders of trust and goodwill.\n",

      "That is what turned the world's opinion. Pakistan stood completely isolated on the world stage. India received widespread support in the world for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do hope that the people of Pakistan too will reflect on these events. We reached out to you with a message of friendship. What did we gain in return? Hundreds lost their lives. Relations were spoiled. The resources which ought to have been used for economic and social development were instead spent on war.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need peace in order to raise the standard of living of the people in both countries. For peace, we need trust. Has trust increased on account of all that happened in Kargil? Does the path of armed intrusion lead to friendship?\n",
