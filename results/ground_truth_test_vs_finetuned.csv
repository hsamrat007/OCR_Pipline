/teamspace/studios/this_studio/test/india_news_p000040.jpg,"India not to engage in a nuclear arms race: Jaswant Singh, external affairs minister

You have been engaged in extended talks with the U.S. since the nuclear tests last year. How would you assess the results so far?

Firstly, by restating the objectives from our side. They are two-fold: in the first place, to reconcile the stated U.S. non-proliferation concerns with India's national security objectives; secondly, and, in a broader context, to develop greater mutual understanding so that both countries are enabled to work together in tapping the real potential of a qualitatively new relationship, essential in this post-Cold War environment.

The results of my discussions with Mr. Strobe Talbott are encouraging. There is recognition that India shall maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent as determined by us. There is now no longer any talk of a 'roll-back'. The U.S. also accepts that India's security concerns are not geographically limited. Foreign policy tasks and challenges are a continuing process; therefore, we need to consolidate these understandings across all sections that make up the U.S. foreign policy establishment.

Do you have a timeframe for concluding this dialogue?

In the management of foreign policy, deadlines are both impractical and unrealistic. But if we manage through the objectives, then the first part is the restoration of our relationship to the pre-May 1998 position. As for the next, I would consider it attained when both India and the U.S. engage in regular dialogue on a range of issues covering bilateral, regional and global political and economic issues.

Can you define these issues?

Of course, I cannot draw up a total list. But, self-evidently, these would range from discussing cooperation in the field of energy, science and technology, environment, trade, taxation and economic development, to global concerns such as terrorism, narcotics, non-proliferation, disarmament, reform of multilateral institutions, expansion of the U.N. Security Council and regional developments in Asia-Pacific etc. Obviously, a multifaceted dialogue of this nature can simply not imply an agreement on all; it is the density and depth of engagement that is the criteria.

A principal item on the agenda is the CTBT and there seems to be considerable confusion about India's stand on this issue. Where exactly are we?

Our stand on the CTBT has been clear. In 1996, we decided that we could not accept the CTBT because it was not consistent with India's national security interest. Over the decades, successive Governments took necessary steps to safeguard India's nuclear option. In 1996, it was clear to all that subscription to the CTBT at that time would have limited India's nuclear potential at an unacceptably low level. After conducting the nuclear tests of May 1998, to validate and update our technology, we have ensured the credibility of our nuclear deterrent into the foreseeable future; our scientists are now confident of conducting sub-critical tests, as also other non-explosive R&D activity necessary for the purpose. That is why, we declared a voluntary moratorium. This, in essence, meets the basic obligations of the CTBT. We also announced a willingness to convert this undertaking into a jure obligation. Clearly, this could not be done in a political vacuum. A positive environment had to be created. In reaction, a number of countries decided to impose restrictive economic measures on India. We have conveyed our disappointment at these actions. That, however, does not mean that we do not value our bilateral relationships with these countries. Our endeavour has been","

THERE IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED STATUTORY, ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL FRAMEWORK TO SAFEGUARD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN INDIA, WHETHER THEY RELATE TO PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHT OR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS. WELL-KNOWN INTERNATIONAL TRADEMARKS HAVE BEEN PROTECTED IN INDIA EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NOT REGISTERED IN INDIA.

Computer software companies have successfully curtailed piracy through court orders. Computer databases have been protected. The courts, under the doctrine of breach of confidentiality, accorded an extensive protection of trade secrets. Right to privacy, which is not protected even in some developed countries, has been recognized in India.

Protection of intellectual property rights in India continues to be strengthened further. The year 1999 witnessed the consideration and passage of major legislation with regard to protection of intellectual property rights in harmony with international practices and in compliance with India's obligations under Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). These include:

1. The Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999 passed by the Indian Parliament on March 10, 1999 to amend the Patents Act of 1970 that provides for establishment of a mail box system to file patents and accords exclusive marketing rights for 5 years.

2. The Trade Marks Bill, 1999, which repeals and replaces the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 passed by the Indian Parliament in the Winter Session that concluded on December 23, 1999.

3. The Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1999 passed by both houses of the Indian Parliament, and signed by the President of India on December 30, 1999.

4. A sui generis legislation for the protection of geographical indications called the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Bill, 1999 approved by both houses of the Indian Parliament on December 23, 1999.

5. The Industrial Designs Bill, 1999, which replaces the Designs Act, 1911 was passed in the Upper House of the Indian Parliament in the Winter Session, which concluded on December 23, 1999 and is presently before the Lower House for its consideration.

6. The Patents (Second Amendment) Bill, 1999 to further amend the Patents Act, 1970 and make it TRIPS compliant was introduced in the Upper House of Indian Parliament on December 20, 1999.

In addition to the above legislative changes, the Government of India has taken several measures to streamline and strengthen the intellectual property administration system in the country. The Trade Marks Registry is also proposed to be further strengthened and modernized. As regards the aspect enforcement, Indian enforcement agencies are now working very effectively and there has been a notable decline in the levels of piracy in India.

Concerns expressed over IPR protection & India's response

Q: India does not provide an effective patent protection in the pharmaceutical sector.

India does provide for patents in the pharmaceutical sector. Currently the patents are restricted to the methods or process of manufacture and not extended to the substances/products themselves. In terms of the TRIPS Agreement, India has time till January 1, 2005 to extend patent protection to this area. The ten-year transition period available for providing product patents to pharmaceutical products is within WTO rules.

Q: It has been further said that India has failed to meet its current obligations required under TRIPS Agreement for implementing appropriate, conforming mailbox and exclusive marketing rights procedures.

The Government of India has taken the following steps to meet its obligations:

1. On December 31, 1994, Government of India promulgated an Ordinance to provide a means to receive product patent applications in the fields of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products and also for grant of exclusive marketing rights. Pursuant to this measure the Indian Patent Office has been receiving product patent applications in those fields.

Wired to the World Leveraging Power Through IT

According to the recently released NASSCOM-McKinsey Study on Indian IT strategies, Indian and India-centric companies have opportunities in four broad areas — value-added IT services, software products, IT-enabled services and e-business. The report suggests that by the year 2008, software and services will contribute over 7.5 per cent of the overall GDP growth of India; exports in the IT sector will account for 35 per cent of the total exports from India; there are a potential 2.2 million jobs in IT by 2008; the IT sector will attract foreign direct investment (FDI) of $4-5 billion; and the overall revenues from the IT sector will be nearly $90 billion including $50 billion in exports. The IT task force is trying to radically enhance per capita productivity of software engineers in India from $15,000-$40,000 at present, to over $1,50,000 which will be comparable to those in the US and Israel. Moreover, if India can shift the focus of its software exports from the low-end to the high-end, then India can be a $100 billion player in the IT world by 2008.

Underestimating India

The situation in southern Asia among the three nuclear weapon powers (China, India and Pakistan) is very different and the present era is different from the Cold War era. Of the three, only India is an open society and a democracy. The other two countries are in a position to keep their nuclear strategy and posture concealed from their public. India has also claimed a no-first-use policy and that makes it all the more important that it should be in a position to project deterrence in a credible manner. That exercise involves both the capability and the will to retaliate. One of the problems India faces in relation to Pakistan is the perception among the political-strategic elite of the latter about India's lack of will to sustain a war.

In these circumstances, it is essential that India should demonstrate in a non-provoking manner its deterrent capability. A minimum deterrent should demonstrate its credibility through the command and control system and the overt and publicised involvement of the armed forces.

There are now more than 1.5 million peoples of Indian origin in America. They reflect the multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-lingual society of India.

Indian-Americans are represented in many fields including academics and entrepreneurs, doctors and lawyers, engineers and financiers.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Indian-American median family income is $60,093 as against the national median family income of $38,885. The high income clearly reflects the advanced educational levels achieved by the community.

More than 87% of Indians in America have completed high school while at least 62% have some college education. As much as 58% of Indian Americans over the age of 25 hold a bachelor's degree or higher.

High levels of education have also enabled Indian-Americans to become a productive segment of the U. S. population, with 72.3% participating in the work force.

Of these work force participants, 43.6% are employed in managerial and professional specialties.

Technical, sales, and administrative support occupations constitute another 33.2% of the work force.

The remaining 23.3% of the population works in other areas, such as operators, fabricators, laborers and precision production.

More than 5,000 Indian-Americans today serve as faculty members in institutions of higher education in the U. S.

About 300,000 Indian-Americans work in technology firms in California's Silicon Valley. They account for more than 15% of high-tech startups in that region. The average income of Indian-Americans in that region is estimated to be $200,000 a year.

Two Indian-Americans - late Har Gobind Khorana of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and late Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar of University of Chicago - were awarded the Nobel Prize, in medicine and physics respectively.

In deed, the NASA's premier X-ray observatory was named the Chandra X-ray Observatory in honor of the late Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Known to the world as Chandra, he was widely regarded as one of the foremost astrophysicists of the twentieth century. The observatory was launched into space in July 1999.

Dr. Kalpana Chawla added a new chapter to the history of the Indian-American community. In 1997, She became the first Indian or Indian-American to fly in the US space shuttle. She was part of the Space Shuttle Columbia Flight STS-87.

The estimated annual buying power of Indian-Americans in the United States is around twenty billion dollars annually.

Indian-Americans are increasingly beginning to take a more direct role in political activities. They have traditionally exercised the most political influence through their campaign contributions, and are actively involved in fundraising efforts for political candidates on the federal, state and local levels.

As a result of these activities, together with the growing commercial interest in investment in India, the India caucus in the House of Representatives now numbers 118.","

The estimated annual buying power of Indian-Americans in the United States is around twenty billion dollars annually.

Indian-Americans are increasingly beginning to take a more direct role in political activities. They have traditionally exercised the most political influence through their campaign contributions, and are actively involved in fundraising efforts for political candidates on the federal, state and local levels.

As a result of these activities, together with the growing commercial interest in investment in India, the India caucus in the House of Representatives now numbers 118."

In the early 1960's, the United States had offered substantial assistance to India in setting up an Equatorial Rocket Launching Station at Thumba (TERLS). Subsequently, India dedicated this facility to the United Nations in 1968. Since then, scientists from various countries have launched more than 3000 sounding rockets for research purposes.

During 1975-76, under a collaborative bilateral agreement, an experiment, Satellite Instrumental Television Experiment (SITE) was conducted. Under this agreement, a U.S. satellite, ATS-6, beamed educational programs to direct reception television sets to 2400 far flung villages exposing them to a new and immensely powerful medium of television.

Anuradha, an Indian experiment for cosmic ray studies was part of NASA's third Spacelab mission.

The Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG) and Survey of India have made use of data received from NASA's MAGSAT Satellite for research and analysis.

India has also participated in Guest Investigator Program of NASA's Einstein and HEAO-B X-ray astronomy satellites.

The United States supplied samples of lunar material collected by its lunar probes to India for research purposes.

Under a Memorandum of Understanding between India and U.S. signed in 1977, India received data from LANDSAT satellites.

Under a commercial arrangement, Space Imaging of Denver, CO markets the Indian Remote Sensing satellite images of panchromatic resolution of 5m — which until recently has been the best available in the public domain.

In 1997, NASA & NDAA of United States and Indian Space Research Organization & the Department of Science and Technology of India have agreed to share meteorological data from India's INSAT satellites. Under this agreement, collaborative research in the area of earth & atmospheric sciences will also be undertaken.

The Task Force has already submitted its recommendations, which are under active consideration. Norms for the operations of venture capital funds have also been liberalized to boost the industry. The Government of India is also actively providing fiscal incentives and liberalizing norms for FDI and raising capital abroad.

Recently, an IT committee was set up by the Ministry of Information Technology, Government of India, comprising NRI professionals from the United States to seek expertise and advice and also to step up U.S. investments in India's IT sector. The committee is chaired by the Minister of Information Technology, Government of India, and members include Secretary, Ministry of Information Technology and a large number of important Indian-American IT entrepreneurs.

The group will:

- Monitor global IT developments and refine Indian IT policy to meet global requirements. Specifically, this will help angel investors, venture creators and incubation;
- Promote the growth of human resource development in the IT sector with the aim of creating quality-based education;
- Promote R&D in the sector by identifying thrust areas and drawing up a blueprint for action.

India's most prized resource in today's knowledge driven economic world is its readily available technical work force. It has the second largest English-speaking scientific professionals in the world, second only to the U.S. It is estimated that India has over 4 million technical workers and over 1,832 educational institutions and polytechnics which train more than 67,785 computer software professionals every year.

The first sub cabinet level meeting of the forum was held in Washington, DC in June and the cabinet level meeting is scheduled for September 2000.

In a recent report, Ernst & Young, a leading international consulting firm, projected a growth rate of 7-8% for Indian economy in the next few years based on the anticipated performance of new economy sectors and government policies continuing to emphasise reforms. Growth could be faster, the report stated, if the time lag between policy formulation and implementation is reduced.

The U.S. investor community is today increasingly sharing this confidence in the future of the Indian economy. As the Indian economy grows and second-generation reforms are implemented, Indo-U.S. bilateral ties are bound to strengthen further. The growing synergy between the two countries in the technology sectors and a mutually shared respect for democracy, rule of law and well established business practices make the two countries natural business partners.

Yes, one thing has certainly come down. It is the rate of inflation. At 1.3 percent, this is the lowest rate in seventeen years.

There has also been a sea change in the way the world sees us. Last year we had taken a major step — Pokharan-2 — which was essential for our security, a step which had been contemplated for long but which could not be taken because of the pressures which were put on successive governments.

Some did not agree with our assessment. Some even sought to portray us as an irresponsible nation. However today, within a year, in the councils of the world, ""India"" is synonymous with ""responsibility"".

The world has seen that we will protect our national interest at all costs: whether it is in developing an atomic weapons capability, whether it is in developing missile-capability, whether it is in driving advertisements out of our land:

The world has seen that we will withstand all pressures that are intended to keep us from taking the measures that we consider necessary in our national interest;

Also the world has seen that whatever we will do will be for self-defence, never for aggression.

But the world has also seen that we are capable of doing so with utmost restraint, with utmost responsibility. These were the principles, which guided us when Pakistan forced the Kargil war on us. Our response was well-thought out. It was so effective that it left the enemy stunned.

The world today has well realized that we would do whatever is required to protect our country. The world has also understood that we would act with utmost responsibility and restraint even when so gravely provoked. This has raised the reputation of India in the international community.

The Lahore bus journey was taken to improve our relations with Pakistan. This made the world realize that we truly want peace and friendship. This journey was not a snowpiece. It was a serious and well-considered move, which we made fully well that there could be risks in it.

Our honesty made an impact on the international community. Later, when the bus to Lahore was taken to Kargil, it did not take much time for the world to realize that Pakistan not only violated the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration, but it also crossed the borders of trust and goodwill.

That is what turned the world's opinion. Pakistan stood completely isolated on the world stage. India received widespread support in the world for the first time.

All of you are familiar with the saying ""Karela Aur Neem Chadha"" (The bitterness of Karela is further worsened by adding to it the bitterness of Neem.) In our case, over thirty five thousand of our people have been killed by terrorists. Terrorism has become a big problem in many other parts of the world, too. It is obstructing the path of peace and development. Today, there is a need to mobilize world opinion against terrorism. Today, on the occasion of Independence Day, India stands with full self-confidence. Our gaze is turned to the future. Our standing in the world has risen. Now, the people are not attracted by the controversies and narrow disputes of yesterday. Throughout the war in Karig, I was specially satisfied by two features. There was no communal tension anywhere in the country. Goodwill and brotherhood prevailing everywhere, including in Jammu and Kashmir. This must have despaired those who thought that riots would break out in India as soon as the spark of war is lit. Those who hatched the conspiracy of strife, must have been truly disillusioned. The people of all sections of society worked for India's success in the war. A powerful wave of patriotism traveled everywhere. When I went to Karig and met our jawans, I saw our entire country there: soldiers from Nagaland, from Assam, from Tamil Nadu, from almost every state were fighting for the country. There was not the slightest distance between them on account of caste or religion or region. This is the real India. We must make their oneness our own. We have to live for this India. We have to work for this India. And, if necessary, we have to lay down our lives for this India, as our brave jawans did. Kargil has once again shown that whenever our patriotism is aroused, all of us stand as one with full confidence and determination, as a fist clenched in conviction. We face our challenges unitedly. Our adversaries should beware of this. At the same time, there is an equally important lesson for us. Now that the crisis has been beaten back, do not unclench this fist of unity. The battle is not over. New challenges are knocking at our doors. The patriotism that coursed through the veins of Indians should be made a permanent feature of our lives. All of us remember the talisman Gandhiji gave us: when in doubt about what to do, he taught us, think of the least, of the most helpless man you have seen, ask yourself, ""Will this step be in his interest?"" he said, and you will see all your doubts melt away. Kargil gives us a second talisman: As we contemplate a step, let us ask ourselves: ""Is it worthy of the soldier who gave his life on those mountains? Does the impulse which lies behind it measure up to the spirit which filled that soldier as he fought to protect our Motherland?"" The challenges that confront us cannot be overcome only by the men on the frontiers doing their duty. There is a need for an organized and disciplined nation to stand behind them. We must defend our country and develop our society by keeping national interests utmost in our minds. If our economy is not strong, and if we are not self-reliant in important matters of national security, then we cannot successfully face external challenges. All of us, wherever we may be, whatever work we may be doing, we should discharge our responsibilities well. We must never allow any limb of our nation or society to become weak. It is clear from the effective way in which we have overcome our challenges and dealt with our difficulties, that we can do anything if we resolve to do it. What is needed is to take a pledge: that whatever we can do, we will now do. I have a vision of India: an India free of hunger and fear, an India free of illiteracy and want. I dream of an India that is prosperous, strong and caring. An India, that regains a place of honour in the comity of great nations. Come, let us build an India in which we have balanced development that benefits all regions and all sections of society. I note with regret that several regions in the country — including the North-Eastern States — have been the victims of unbalanced progress. The nation has an especially pressing obligation to bring the people of the North-East into the developmental mainstream. Come, let us build an India in which Dalits, Adivasis, and Backward Classes are not only freed from economic deprivation, but also enjoy the fruits of social justice. The path that will take us to this ideal is the path of samata, mamata, and samajik samarasata.

bined with religious extremism, it becomes a graver danger to humanity. All of you are familiar with the saying ""Karela Aur Neem Chadha"" (The bitterness of Karela is further worsened by adding to it the bitterness of Neem.)

In our case, over thirty five thousand of our people have been killed by terrorists. Terrorism has become a big problem in many other parts of the world, too. It is obstructing the path of peace and development. Today, there is a need to mobilize world opinion against terrorism. Today, on the occasion of Independence Day, India stands with full self-confidence. Our gaze is turned to the future. Our standing in the world has risen. Now, the people are not attracted by the controversies and narrow disputes of yesterday. Throughout the war in Kargil, I was specially satisfied by two features.

There was no communal tension anywhere in the country. Goodwill and brotherhood prevailed everywhere, including in Jammu and Kashmir. This must have despaired those who thought that riots would break out in India as soon as the spark of war is lit. Those who hatched the conspiracy of strife, must have been truly disillusioned. The people of all sections of society worked for India's success in the war. A powerful wave of patriotism traveled everywhere.

When I went to Kargil and met our jawans, I saw our entire country there: soldiers from Nagaland, from Assam, from Tamil Nadu, from almost every state were fighting for the country. There was not the slightest distance between them on account of caste or religion or region.

This is the real India. We must make their oneness our own. We have to live for this India. We have to work for this India. And, if necessary, we have to lay down our lives for this India, as our brave jawans did.

Kargil has once again shown that whenever our patriotism is aroused, all of us stand as one with full confidence and determination, as a fist clenched in conviction. We face our challenge unitedly. Our adversaries should beware of this.

At the same time, there is an equally important lesson for us. Now that the crisis has been beaten back, do not unclench this fist of unity.

The battle is not over. New challenges are knocking at our doors. The patriotism that coursed through the veins of Indians should be made a permanent feature of our lives.

All of us remember the talisman Gandhiji gave us: when in doubt about what to do, he taught us, think of the least, of the most helpless men you have seen, ask yourself, ""Will this step be in your interest?"" he said, and you will see all your doubts melt away.

Kargil gives us a second talisman: As we contemplate a step, let us ask ourselves: ""Is it worthy of the soldier who gave his life on those mountains? Does the impulse which lies behind it measure up to the spirit which filled that soldier as he fought to protect our Motherland?""

The challenges that confront us cannot be overcome only by the men on the frontiers doing their duty. There is a need for an organized and disciplined nation to stand behind them. We must defend our country and develop our society by keeping national interests utmost in our minds. If our economy is not strong, and if we are not self-reliant in important matters of national security, then we cannot successfully face external challenges.

All of us, wherever we may be, whatever work we may be doing, we should discharge our responsibilities well. We must never allow any limb of our nation or society to become weak. It is clear from the effective way in which we have overcome our challenges and dealt with our difficulties, that we can do anything if we resolve to do it. What is needed is to take a pledge: that whatever we can do, we will now do.

I have a vision of India: an India free of hunger and fear, an India free of illiteracy and want.

I dream of an India that is prosperous, strong and caring. An India, that regains a place of honour in the comity of great nations.

Come, let us build an India in which we have balanced development that benefits all regions and all sections of society. I note with regret that several regions in the country — including the North-Eastern States — have been the victims of unbalanced progress. The nation has an especially pressing obligation to bring the people of the North-East into the developmental mainstream.

Come, let us build an India in which Dalits, Adivasis, and Backward Classes are not only freed from economic deprivation, but also enjoy the fruits of social justice. The path that will take us to this ideal is the path of samata, mamata, and samajik samarasata.

Come, let us build an India in which our nari shakti — our women — are able to realize its full potential — from shaping the future of their families to shaping the future of the nation"

A “Tilt” towards India

Two years ago, India’s nuclear tests provoked worldwide condemnation and retaliatory sanctions by the United States. Yet in recent months, culminating in Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s visit to Washington last weekend, the United States has drawn closer to India diplomatically than at any time since the early 1960’s. President Clinton has shaped a new foreign policy course in South Asia by embracing India and distancing the United States from Pakistan’s military government. These steps have far-reaching ramifications for all of Asia, including China, as well as for the issue of nuclear proliferation. The shift is justified by India’s growing importance.

At This Dinner, Harmony Is Served

India and America clinked glasses in their new whirlwind friendship at an elaborate and exotic state dinner at the White House last night as Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee profusely praised Bill and Hillary Clinton—and also Christopher Columbus, “who set sail for India but landed in America. I wonder where we would be if he had actually reached India.”

The line got a big laugh from the nearly 700 assorted political, business and entertainment glitterati lucky enough to snag one of the coveted seats in what was by far the largest—and possibly last—such event of the Clinton administration.

Editorial, New York Times - September 20, 2000

Vajpayee’s After Dedication Speech

(Continued from page 9)

It has taken a very short time — from March to September — for our two countries to come a long way. At the same time, it seems that New Delhi and Washington are not a long way off from each other. I describe this period as “Six Months That Cemented the Natural Alliance Between India and America”. The Vision Document we signed in New Delhi has been translated into a specific forward movement in a number of areas in the Joint Statement adopted in Washington.

It reflects the synergy of our manual interests.

We have laid a solid foundation for stronger and more broad-based economic cooperation between our two countries. I am confident that this foundation will support the attractive architecture of Indo-American relations in the coming years.

But going beyond the mutuality of economic opportunities, our two sides have talked candidly about several important issues that form the texture of our bilateral relations.

We have talked about security matters. We have talked about the situation in South Asia. We have also talked about threat of terrorism to civilized world order.

Of course, differences are bound to be there between the two countries. But dialogue between democracies, in an atmosphere of candour and trust, never fails to dissolve some if not all differences.

And that is what has happened on account of the continuing dialogue at various levels between our two democracies.

From divergence, we have moved to a convergence of thinking and outlook on a broad range of issues.

I heartily thank all those who have contributed to the success of this dialogue.

I especially applaud the consistent efforts of the Indian-American community. Your patience and hard work are paying off. Keep it up.

I thank all of you for the opportunity of sharing my thoughts with you.

Thank you.","

Sisters, Brothers and Dear Children,

Accept my greetings on the sacred occasion of Independence Day. This is a day of hallowed remembrance for us. This is a day of dedication for us.

This year's Independence Day has special significance for all of us. The present century is coming to an end. The world will have entered the next century by the time of the next Independence Day.

As we stand at the sunset of the 20th century, and look back at the events of the era that has passed, we see the end of colonialism from Indian soil to be the most important development. Our great leaders, and many generations of our countrymen, waged a powerful struggle for independence. By doing so, they paved the way for the independence of other countries, too. We pay our homage to those self-sacrificing and devoted leaders and patriots who struggled for freedom throughout their lives, and, when necessary, even laid down their lives as aahutl (offering) in the great yagya of freedom.

Come, all my countrymen, let us strive to become worthy heirs to those great leaders. We dedicate today's sacred day to their memory.

In the same way, I offer my condolences to the valiant jawans, officers and others belonging to the Army and the Air Force, who displayed magnificent heroism and the spirit of sacrifice in recapitulating that part of our Motherland in Kargil from the enemy. All of us bow our heads in gratitude for those who were martyred in the Kargil war.

Almost all our countrymen have seen on television glimpses of the impossible summits, which our heroes overcame and pushed out the enemy. To gain victory at such heights is not only to surmount the sky-piercing peaks, it displays the full might of the nation. It is a symbol of the bravery of our Armed Forces.

How can we forget such heroes?

How can we forget those wounded soldiers whose only wish was: how fast can we get well and rejoin our battalion to repulse the enemy?

How can we forget the members of the families of those brave martyrs, who, on receiving the body of their beloved, said, ""We do not have tears in our eyes, we have pride in our heart""? How can we forget the mother whose lament was that she had had only one son, and therefore could not send another to fight for our country?

I know that mere words of solace are not enough. We have to take concrete measures for the families of the martyrs and wounded soldiers so that they may live a life of comfort and dignity. It has been said that we remember and honour soldiers during a war, and in the immediate aftermath. But as the days pass, we forget them. And it is a sad fact that many who sacrificed their life and limb in previous wars were often forgotten. I give you my personal pledge that this will not happen again.

This Red Fort and its world-renowned ramparts are not merely a geographical spot. The very heartbeat of India's freedom struggle is linked to this fort and its ramparts. In the First War of Independence of 1857, this is where Bahadur Shah Zafar was held a prisoner.

Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose made this very fort the target of his campaign in 1943 and, blowing the bugle of independence, gave the stirring call to his countrymen: ""Dilli Chalo, Chalo Lal Kile""

It is from this very fort that our first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted for the first time, the tricolour of Free India in 1947.

More than half a century has passed. Today, we stand at the threshold of a new era. Come, let us enter this new era united in step and united in resolve.

When I addressed you from this rampart last year, there was uncertainty and cynicism in the atmosphere. It was being asked:

Will we be able to withstand economic sanctions?
To what extent will we be able to ward off the economic crisis, which had struck the Tiger economies of Southeast Asia?
Will the Government be allowed to carry on its work?

Today, speaking to a self-confident India, I declare:

Sanctions have lost their effect. They have become a thing of the past. We have dealt with them in such a way that they hardly had any effect on our economy;
We kept the Southeast Asian economic crisis at bay;
Yes, the Government that was brought down, but the country was not. It continued to march ahead, fulfilling the mantra of Charaiveti, Charaiveti (Move on, Move on). The Government continued to discharge its duty.
Most important, a war was imposed on us.

We have not just triumphed over difficulties, we have achieved much. In spite of obstacles that were put in our way,

Prime Minister Vajpayee's Independence Day address to the Nation

Sisters, Brothers and Dear Children,

Accept my greetings on the sacred occasion of Independence Day. This is a day of hallowed remembrance for us. This is a day of dedication for us.

This year's Independence Day has special significance for all of us. The present century is coming to an end. The world will have entered the next century by the time of the next Independence Day.

As we stand at the sunset of the 20th century, and look back at the events of the era that has passed, we see the end of colonialism from Indian soil to be the most important development. Our great leaders, and many generations of our countrymen, waged a powerful struggle for independence. By doing so, they paved the way for the independence of other countries, too. We pay our homage to those self-sacrificing and devoted leaders and patriots who struggled for freedom throughout their lives, and, when necessary, even laid down their lives as aahuti (offering) in the great yagya of freedom.

Come, all my countmen, let us strive to become worthy heirs to those great leaders. We dedicate today's sacred day to their memory.

In the same way, I offer my condolences to the valiant jawans, officers and others belonging to the Army and the Air Force, who displayed magnificent heroism and the spirit of sacrifice in recapturing that part of our Motherland in Kargil from the enemy. All of us bow our heads in gratitude for those who were martyred in the Kargil war.

INS Mysore, an Indian Navy guided missile destroyer, participated in the International Naval Review on July 4, 2000 in New York. A ship of the U.S. Navy and 20 other countries participated in this event and was reviewed by the U.S. President Bill Clinton.

INS Mysore earlier made a visit to the Norfolk, VA port between June 27 - 29, 2000 and also took part in the Sail Boston-2000 in Boston on July 11, 2000.

General Purpose Destroyer

Weight: 6,700 ton

Propulsion: 4 gas turbines; 64,000 HP

Top Speed: over 32 Knots

16 Surface-to-surface missiles

Surface-to-air missiles

100 mm gun, 4 - 30 mm Gatling guns

2 Helicopters, anti-submarine rockets, torpedoes and electronic warfare equipment

Commanding Officer: Captain Rajiv Dhamdhere

500 crew members

INS Mysore was designed and built at Mazagon Docks, India.

INS Mysore is the second Indian Naval Ship, which has been christened as MYSORE. The old INS Mysore, a Cruiser, began her life in the Royal Navy as HMS Nigeria on 3rd August 1940. During the Second World War she distinguished herself in various theatres of war from the icy waters of the Arctic to the coral reefs of South East Asia. The ship was transferred to the Indian Navy on 29th August 1957. Her advent symbolised power. Her main armament of 6"" guns could deliver a fusillade of 2.5 tons of explosives a minute on the enemy. Mysore's first adventure in her chequered career was the liberation of Goa in 1961. Her tasks included the speedy capture of Anjadip, neutralisation and capture of the Portuguese frigate Aphonso de Albuquerque, and subsequent administration of the territory. In 1965 Mysore led the Fleet for two sorties in the North East Arabian Sea and off North Saurashtra, but the enemy did not seek action. It fell once again on Mysore to lead the Western Fleet to victory in December 1971, achieving a most effective blockade of Karachi and virtual command of the Arabian Sea. In her twilight years, Mysore served as the Cadets Training Cruiser, the very cradle of professionalism through which many a future officer passed. Till her decommissioning on 29th August 1985, Mysore constantly lived up to her motto: ALWAYS FEARLESS.","

Clinton’s Productive Visit

For the first time, the world’s most populous and most powerful democracies have an agreed vision of the way to foster closer and more cooperative bilateral relations over a decade or two. Moreover, the vision statement is not just an essay in rhetoric; practicality is its hallmark. Above all, an institutional mechanism has been put in place to ensure that the promise is matched by performance.

What makes this declaration of intent credible is that neither side has made any attempt to hide or paper over differences that persist, most notably on the crucial and sensitive nuclear issue. Mr. Clinton has made it clear that while India is the best judge of what it should do about its security, America wants this country to abjure the use of nuclear weapons. Mr. Vajpayee has stated that the minimum nuclear deterrent for the security of the country will remain until there is an elimination of nuclear weapons by all.

The point to note is that the differences of opinion between India and the U.S. on the issues detailed above have been accepted by both sides as existential realities which should not come in the way of a long-term broad-based consolidation and expansion of Indo-U.S. relations. The bilateral agreements and memoranda signed on cooperation in the fields of energy, technology and environment, in addition to the “Vision Statement” and the memoranda signed on institutionalising bilateral contacts, affirm this approach.

(Continued from page 2)

One of our immediate tasks will be to firmly put down terrorism, which has come to cast its cruel shadow on innocent people. Our message is loud and clear: The life of every India citizen under our dispensation is precious. In our fight against terrorism, we will be guided by the principle of 'Zero Tolerance'.

The same principle of 'Zero Tolerance' will apply while dealing with corruption that has bred contempt for the law. One of the first legislations we will take up is the Lokpal Bill so that the rot can be checked from the top.

A broad consensus already exists on electoral reforms to weed out muscle and money power. We propose to soon introduce in Parliament a comprehensive electoral reform Bill.

We often talk of the future belonging to our youth. But, for decades their problems, especially that of unemployment, have remained unattended. We believe that our young women and men will be the architects of the 'new' India of the 21st century.

I am confident that a buoyant national economy will create tremendous employment opportunities. I am equally confident that our focus on education and health will prepare today's youth for tomorrow's challenges.

The Government of free India had set itself the noble task of wiping every tear from every eye, of ending centuries-old discriminations and social inequities. Somewhere along the journey from freedom to the eve of this century, Government lost track of that task.

Illiteracy is a curse and a denial of human dignity. As is gender discrimination or, for that matter, lack of something as basic and essential as drinking water and primary health care.

My dear countrymen,

India today needs a Government that cares;

India needs a Government that will reach out to the last person in the last row.

Our Government pledges itself to narrowing the gap between our performance and your expectation.

The Mandate of '99 is a bond of trust between people and Government.

We shall not betray this trust.

With the help of a billion people proud of being Indian,

There is nothing that we cannot achieve;

No problem we cannot tackle;

No challenge we cannot face; and,

No opportunity we cannot seize.

Jai Hind!","

He added that India only wants to maintain a credible deterrent nuclear defense capability. Mr. Jaswant Singh, gave the reassurance in his speech on ""India and ASEAN: Security Paradigms for AD 2000"" organized by the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies during his visit to Singapore. India plays a strategic role in regional stability, asserted Mr. Jaswant Singh, but it does not pose a threat to its neighbors. ""India has neither been, nor has it been perceived to be 'regemonic'. It has never exported any disturbing or destabilizing ideology. It has not sought to dominate through trade,"" the Indian Minister told his audience at the meeting. ""But India does seek to increase its economic engagement with the rest of the world. It is vital, therefore, to ensure peace and stability on India's borders and in the regions with which it has increased interactions."" ""Today, we are ASEAN's geographical neighbors with greater interactions on economic, political and security interests than ever before. The engagement of a militarily stronger, economically prosperous, democratic and secular India imparts greater stability to the region,"" he said. On India's bilateral dispute with Pakistan, Mr. Jaswant Singh said the issue could be addressed through dialogue. But he noted that an ""environment conducive for dialogue requires that you stop promoting cross-border terrorism, advocating jihad as an instrument of foreign policy"". Mr. Jaswant Singh said establishing and managing a stable, tolerant and secular state is a common problem faced by many countries in the region. It is also an issue that can be complicated by externally induced factors. He said the goal is to forge a common endeavor to create political stability and security in the region. Indian Science Delegation in Washington May 26, 2000 Dr. R.A. Mashelkar, Secretary, Government of India, Scientific & Industrial Research and Director General, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, addressed Washington based science diplomats of different countries at a function organized at the Indian embassy today. Dr. Mashelkar emphasized India's tremendous competitive advantages in facing the challenges of the new century, which could turn it into a global R&D center. By the year 2015, 55% of India's population will be under 20 years ago giving India a large human resource pool of 600 to 700 million young adults. This would in turn provide a tremendous cost advantage to India's R&D giving it the highest return on investment in knowledge industries. Dr. Mashelkar also highlighted India's rich bio-diversity, and the need to use it for the propagation of the 5 Es- Economic Development, Equity, Ethics, Environment and Ecology. In this context, he pointed out the need to integrate and network strongly with other countries including the USA for the greater benefit of all man-kind. Ambassador Naresh Chandra also addressed the delegates on various aspects of Indo-U.S. relations, particularly the agreement setting up the Indo-U.S. Science and Technology forum concluded during President Clinton's recent visit to India.

India’s Minister of External Affairs Jaswant Singh said India has no intention of engaging in any arms race. He added that India only wants to maintain a credible deterrent nuclear defense capability.

Mr. Jaswant Singh, gave the reassurance in his speech on “India and ASEAN: Security Paradigms for AD 2000” organized by the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies during his visit to Singapore. India plays a strategic role in regional stability, asserted Mr. Jaswant Singh, but it does not pose a threat to its neighbors.

“India has neither been, nor has it been perceived to be “hegemonic”. It has never exported any disturbing or destabilizing ideology. It has not sought to conquer or even covet others territory, it has not sought to dominate through trade,” the Indian Minister told his audience at the meeting.

“But India does seek to increase its economic engagement with the rest of the world.

It is vital, therefore, to ensure peace and stability on

India's borders and in the regions with which it has increased interactions.

“Today, we are ASEAN’s geographical neighbors with greater interactions on economic, political and security interests than ever before. The engagement of a militarily stronger, economically prosperous, democratic and secular India imparts greater stability to the region,” he said.

On India’s bilateral dispute with Pakistan, Mr. Jaswant Singh said the issue could be addressed through dialogue. But he noted that an “environment conducive for dialogue requires that you stop promoting cross-border terrorism, advocating jihad as an instrument of foreign policy”.

Mr. Jaswant Singh said establishing and managing a stable, tolerant and secular state is a common problem faced by many countries in the region. It is also an issue that can be complicated by externally induced factors. He said the goal is to forge a common endeavor to create political stability and security in the region.

Indian Science Delegation in Washington

May 26, 2000

Dr. R.A. Mashelkar, Secretary, Government of India, Scientific & Industrial Research and Director General, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, addressed Washington based science diplomats of different countries at a function organized at the Indian embassy today.

Dr. Mashelkar emphasized India’s tremendous competitive advantages in facing the challenges of the new century, which could turn it into a global R&D center. By the year 2015, 55% of India’s population will be under 20 years age giving India a large human resource pool of 600 to 700 million young adults. This would in turn provide a tremendous cost advantage to India’s R&D giving it the highest return on investment in knowledge industries. Dr. Mashelkar also highlighted India’s rich bio-diversity, and the need to use it for the propagation of the 5 Es- Eco-omic Development, Equity, Ethics, Environment and Ecology. In this context, he pointed out the need to integrate and network strongly with other countries including the USA for the greater benefit of all mankind.

Ambassador Naresh Chandra also addressed the delegates on various aspects of Indo-U.S. relations, particularly the agreement setting up the Indo-U.S. Science and Technology forum concluded during President Clinton’s recent visit to India.

Excerpts from an article written by Dewang Mehta, Director, National Association of Software and Service Companies

The Indian software industry has zoomed from a mere $20 million ten years ago to a whopping US $3.9 billion in 1998-99. No industry has done as much for the competitiveness of global corporations and, certainly, no industry has created as many millionaires in India in such a short span of time. In 1998-99, 203 out of the Fortune 500 outsourced their software requirements from India. And US customers bought 61 percent of the software that Indian companies exported to 91 countries around the world.

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, by picking the Indian city of Hyderabad to house his company's first-ever development center outside the US, has already paid the ultimate tribute to the skill-base of the industry.

Internet and E-Commerce

Industry experts believe that once the Internet — although there are just about 1.4 million users today, has the potential to explode to 37 million once Net connections are available on cable-spreads across India, and will position India as a global hub for content development and e-commerce. Currently, more than 437 of Indian softwarehouses provide web-based applications and services. That the Internet is becoming an integral part of the Indian software business is also evident from its use alongside that of high-speed satellite connectivity for software development and delivery. The delivery through high-speed connectivity has been a successful factor for globalization of the Indian software industry.

Already, in the year 1999-2000, Internet and E-Commerce related software solutions exports from India are expected to bring US $340 million out of estimated US $3.9 billion of Indian software exports. This is expected to increase to US $2 billion of e-commerce solutions exports by 2002, when total Indian software exports are projected to be US $8.7 billion, during that year.

Global Presence

Already, 212 Indian software companies have either subsidiaries or branches overseas, mostly in the US. Proximity to markets is helping them to anticipate market conditions and client requirements, besides strengthening relationships further and helping build-enduring partnerships.

High Quality

According to NASSCOM's survey, out of the top 300 companies, about 140 software companies have acquired ISO 9000 certification, and about 70 more companies are in the pipeline to be certified. In fact, the Indian software industry will soon have more ISO 9000-certified companies than any other country in the world. Many of its members are now focusing on acquiring SEI-CMM (Software Engineering Institute - Capability Maturity Model) certificates of quality.

The State

In India, the success of software industry can be attributed in no small measure to the excellent teamwork between Government and Industry. The Government of India, impressed by the excellent performance of the Indian software industry has provided all support, including fiscal benefits, the availability of high-speed data communications and infrastructure, besides ensuring an almost red tape-free system. The government, in fact, has given the red-carpet treatment to this industry. The fiscal benefits include trade free zones, Software Technology Park schemes, zero import duty on software, and 100% exemption on profits from software exports.

India and US sign pact for lifting Quantitative Restrictions

After months of negotiations India and US inked an agreement for a 15-month phase-out of import curbs between the two countries. Announcing this U.S. Trade Representatives Charline Barshefsky said that tariff restrictions on half of the 1400 odd India still maintained on imports from U.S. would be lifted by April 1, 2000. On the remaining 714 items India would lift the import curbs by April 1, 2001, She said adding items on which India maintained import restrictions included agriculture and textile items. India had originally maintained what has come to be known as quantitative restrictions on imports from United States in as many as 2,700 items. As per the WTO agreement India had to phase out these import curbs and it had so far dismantled it on over 1,300 items. The curbs were maintained for balance of payments purposes. On the phase-out of the remaining 1429 tariff lines, there was a dispute between India and US over the phase out time schedule. With the rejection of New Delhi's plea by the WTO appellate panel in September last, the two countries concluded the bilateral agreement here recently.

/teamspace/studios/this_studio/test/india_news_p000029.jpg,"Note on Violation of India's airspace by Pakistan's Atlantique aircraft and consequent action

On August 10, 1999, a Pakistani Naval Anti-Submarine Warfare and maritime reconnaissance aircraft, called Atlantique, intruded 10 Kms into Indian Territory in the Area of KORI CREEK.

The intruding aircraft was detected by IAF ground radars and was intercepted 10 Kms south of the International Border. When the IAF fighters closed in to identify and signal the intruding Pakistani aircraft to force it to land at an Indian base, the Pakistani aircraft acted in a hostile manner by turning into our fighter. At that stage the Atlantique was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a MIG-21 of the IAF, which hit the aircraft on the port engine which caught fire.

Following is a comprehensive note on the incident:

Intruding aircraft was of the Atlantique type. It is well-known to defence forces, especially navy/air forces all over the world, that this is an advanced military aircraft with following essential capabilities:

- The aircraft can not only carry out marine reconnaissance but also do surveillance / aerial photography and electronic intelligence gathering.

- Can carry a substantial weapons load (3.5 tonnes in the case of Pakistan version). This includes bombs, air-to-surface missiles and weapons meant for anti-ship and anti-submarine role, as well as air-to-air missiles.

- Pak military aircraft came well into Indian air space (up to 10 km). This was clearly a deep intrusion and violation of our air space in contravention of universally accepted norms of conduct in bilateral relation.

This intrusion was also a blatant violation of the 1991 Agreement between India and Pakistan on Prevention of Air Space Violations and for permitting over flights and landings by military aircraft. The crucial provision in this Agreement is that aircraft of this type will not fly within 10 Kms of each other's air space, except by prior permission.

Pakistan neither informed us nor sought prior permission as required by the Agreement.

Details of intrusions, aircraft type (as described above), mode of activity including movements of the aircraft, and its conduct after it was engaged by our air force, Pakistan's own statements thereafter make it clear beyond doubt that this was in no way a case of an innocent entry or straying into Indian air space, but a deliberate, planned operation for surveillance/reconnaissance and intelligence gathering, using a sophisticated reconnaissance/combat aircraft for this purpose.

It is crucial to recognise that surveillance / reconnaissance / intelligence gathering is an offensive military operation and a hostile activity. It cannot be passed off as harmless.

The central issue therefore is not whether Pakistan aircraft was ""armed"" or ""unarmed"". The issue is that it was a military aircraft engaged in offensive and hostile military operation compounded by its combat capabilities.

Pak Information Minister was quoted by BBC, soon after the incident, as stating that the aircraft was on a ""surveillance mission"". Subsequently, the Pak Government spokesman stated that it was on a training mission.

Following points are relevant in this connection:

- A genuine, routine training mission would never operate in sensitive border areas, leave alone violate the air space of a neighbouring country especially at a time of tension. This is precisely what the Pak aircraft was doing.

- If the aircraft was flying out towards the high seas on a genuine mission, it could have traversed a more westward route away from the sensitive border areas.

- If it was on a training mission, this would have to be linked with maritime reconnaissance. It was operating over a land area - covering part of our territory.

- The aircraft was at a height of 5,000-10,000 feet. This is an unusually low height for an aircraft supposedly on a training mission. Low altitude is, however, essential for carrying out photography of ground features.

- Area over which the Atlantique was executing its manoeuvres, is a sensitive border area and it has many ingress and infiltration routes. The indication is that the aircraft was engaged in reconnaissance, photography and surveillance over these features, as well as of ground activity on the Sir Creek area.

Though the intrusion was not in this area, the aircraft is capable of photographing at an angle. Further, there are a number of sensitive defence installations and major civilian (industrial and scientific) centres on our side near the area of intrusion, and further beyond the western sea coast of India.

The aircraft intruded / four times into Indian air space. After first entry, it carried out a circular movement, exited and entered again making another circular movement, it was after the fourth return into Indian territory, that it was encountered and engaged.","

3.1. India’s nuclear forces will be effective, enduring, diverse, flexible, and responsive to the requirements in accordance with the concept of credible minimum deterrence. These forces will be based on a triad of aircraft, mobile land-based missiles and sea-based assets in keeping with the objectives outlined above.

Survivability of the forces will be enhanced by a combination of multiple redundant systems, mobility, dispersion and deception.

3.2. The doctrine envisages assured capability to shift from peacetime deployment to fully employable forces in the shortest possible time, and the ability to retaliate effectively even in a case of significant degradation by hostile strikes.

4. Credibility and Survivability

4.1. Credibility: Any adversary must know that India can and will retaliate with sufficient nuclear weapons to inflict destruction and punishment that the aggressor will find unacceptable if nuclear weapons are used against India and its forces.

4.2. Effectiveness: The efficacy of India’s nuclear deterrent be maximised through synergy among all elements involving reliability, timeliness, accuracy and weight of the attack.

4.3 Survivability:

(i) India’s nuclear forces and their command and control shall be organised for very high survivability against surprise attacks and for rapid punitive response. They shall be designed and deployed to ensure survival against a first strike and to endure repetitive attrition attempts with adequate retaliatory capabilities for a punishing strike which would be unacceptable to the aggressor.

8. Disarmament and Arms Control

8.1. Global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament is a national security objective. India shall continue its efforts to achieve the goal of a nuclear weapon-free world at an early date.

8.2. Since no-first use of nuclear weapons is India’s basic commitment, every effort shall be made to persuade other States possessing nuclear weapons to join an international treaty banning first use.

8.3. Having provided unqualified negative security assurances, India shall work for internationally binding unconditional negative security assurances by nuclear weapon states to non-nuclear weapon states.

8.4. Nuclear arms control measures shall be sought as part of national security policy to reduce potential threats and to protect our own capability and its effectiveness.

8.5. In view of the very high destructive potential of nuclear weapons, appropriate nuclear risk reduction and confidence building measures shall be sought, negotiated and instituted.","
Nuclear Forces
3.1. India's nuclear forces will be effective, enduring, diverse, flexible, and responsive to the requirements in accordance with the concept of credible minimum deterrence. These forces will be based on a triad of aircraft, mobile land-based missiles, and sea-based assets in keeping with the objectives outlined above.

Survivability of the forces will be enhanced by a combination of multiple redundant systems, mobility, dispersion, and deception.

3.2. The doctrine envisages assured capability to shift from peacetime deployment to fully employable forces in the shortest possible time, and the ability to retaliate effectively even in a case of significant degradation by hostile strikes.

WASHINGTON — Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Thakur and Indian Minister of Health and Family Welfare C. P. Thakur signed a joint agreement June 13, pledging cooperative research in HIV/AIDS prevention and maternal and child health research.

“These joint statements on HIV/AIDS prevention and maternal and child health research will help both countries develop new methods and programs that will improve the health of men, women, and children around the world,” Thakur said at the signing ceremony.

“When President Clinton addressed the Indian parliament in March, he spoke about AIDS and promised America’s partnership in the continuing struggle. The work we undertake today is a further step in meeting that commitment,” she said.

“It is indeed a momentous occasion that the governments of India and the United States are coming together in this collaborative venture in the areas of immediate public health concerning our countries,” said Minister Thakur. “I am confident that these agreements will go a long way in strengthening the friendly ties between our governments and the people of both of our countries.”

Over the past 40 years, scientists from both countries have collaborated on basic and applied biomedical and behavioral research. One outstanding program has been the Indo-U.S. Vaccine Action Program, which supports vaccine research. This thirteen-year-old program is serving as the model for cooperation in both AIDS and maternal and child health areas.

AIDS and maternal and child health areas.

The new agreement commits India and the U.S. to address HIV/AIDS through a disease prevention program. Their plan includes improved surveillance, prevention research, vaccine research and development, technology transfer, and health services research.

Both countries recognize that maternal, neonatal, infant and pediatric mortality and morbidity rates remain unacceptably high. The Indo-U.S. joint effort will focus on nutrition research and the prevention of HIV transmission from mothers to their children.

The participating Indian institutions include the National AIDS Control Organization, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and other Indian agencies, academic institutions, research facilities, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
