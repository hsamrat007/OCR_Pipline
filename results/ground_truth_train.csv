Would you like to elaborate on what then is the essence and thinking on India’s doctrine?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The key elements of India's nuclear policy were spelt out by the Prime Minister in Parliament last December. To recapitulate briefly: (a) India shall maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent and shall undertake necessary measures to ensure its credibility. (b) India has declared a moratorium on undertaking any further underground nuclear test explosions, but R&D activity, including computer simulation and sub-critical tests, will be conducted as necessary. (c) Development work on an extended-range Agni missile is under way and a successful flight test was carried out earlier this year. Additional flight testing will be undertaken in a manner that is non-provocative, transparent and consistent with established international norms and practices. (d) India has declared a no-first-use doctrine. This has implicit in it the principle that India shall not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States. (e) In order that our minimum deterrent be credible, we shall adopt and maintain a deployment posture that ensures survivability of assets. Such a posture, obviously, provides for greater safety and security. (f) India will not engage in any arms race. We shall not, therefore, pursue an open-ended programme. (g) A civilian command and control system, with necessary safeguards, shall cater for all possible contingencies. (h) India's commitment to global nuclear disarmament remains undeluded. We will continue to work with other likeminded countries and take initiatives for moving towards a nuclear weapon-free-world. We will also seek to negotiate CBMs, both in the conventional and nuclear fields, with the aim of reducing lack of trust in the region. Many commentators find these elements inconsistent and believe that India has embarked on a programme that will produce a nuclear arsenal larger than that of the U.K. or France. Do you have any comments? I am aware of such apprehensions. These are born of the Cold War experiences, ideology, indeed, even the cliched phrases of those sterile years. The U.S., Russia, the U.K., France and China developed their nuclear weapons as weapons for war. Most nuclear weapon powers follow doctrines of first use, and all of them envisage tactical or sub-strategic roles for their nuclear weapons. The Indian thinking is different, principally, because we have discarded the Cold War reference frame of nuclear war fighting. In our view, the principal role of nuclear weapons is to deter their use by an adversary. For this, India needs only that strategic minimum which is credible. With the policy of ""retaliation only,"" survivability becomes critical to ensure credibility. This ""minimum,"" however, cannot be a fixed physical quantification; it is a dynamic concept but firmly rooted in the strategic environment, technological imperatives and national security needs, and the actual size, components, deployment and employment of nuclear forces will be decided taking into account all these factors. No other nuclear weapon State has conceptualised its capabilities in such terms. India can, and has done, so, because it does not intend to engage in an arms race. Therefore, the question of an arsenal larger than that of country X or Y becomes a non-question. For India, the question is only one of adequacy that is credible and thus defines our ""minimum."" How would you address concerns about India seeking a ""triad""? Let me address the issue of ""triad,"" not because it is part of the NSAB paper, but because there may be genuine misperceptions. It is a known fact that today India has nuclear capable aircraft and mobile land-based nuclear-capable missiles. We have an R&D programme for a naval version of Prithvi that has been a part of the IGMDP launched in 1983. It is also a fact that many analysts, particularly in Western countries, consider nuclear missiles on sub-marines to be the most survivable nuclear asset in the scenarios that they have thought of - first strike, second strike, war and so on. Our approach is different. It is, therefore, premature to talk of an Indian ""triad."" R&D programmes will certainly continue, aimed at enhancing survivability and thus, credibility, but decisions on production, deployment and employment will be taken on the basis of factors that I have outlined earlier. In short, just as parity is not essential for deterrence, neither is a triad, a prerequisite for credibility. Let me suggest that you look at the Indian nuclear deterrent as a ""triad"" based on a different set of three dimensions - a deterrent that is minimum but"

The Indian American Forum for Political Education was established in 1982 to serve as a non-partisan, non-profit, political educational forum in Washington, DC. The Mission of IAFPE is to empower Indian Americans politically by raising civic consciousness and increasing participation in community affairs and the mainstream political process. Members from all over the United States discuss political issues of their concern, participate in their communities, and find ways to strengthen ties between the United States and India. Annual conventions are held around the country.

The major purposes of the forum are to function as a catalyst in promoting political awareness and developing civic consciousness, promote voter registration and encourage Indian Americans to exercise their rights to vote and to run for public office, identify issues of concern to Indian Americans and pursue solutions within the political system, and to provide opportunities for learning various aspects of issues affecting the lives of individuals of Indian origin residing in the United States. This learning process takes place through discussions on contemporary civic, economic, and political developments.

Indian American woman is among top 50 U.S. pharmacists

Nishamiry Kasbekar, 29, is selected to be among the top 50 pharmacists in the United States. The clinical specialist, who specializes in infectious diseases, has been acknowledged by the American Druggist magazine as among the top 50 influential Pharmacists in the U.S. for her work and implementation of the Anti-microbial Management Program at the Presbyterian Medical Center (PMC), a division of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, in Philadelphia.

This year, she won both the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists’ Best Practice Award and the Pennsylvania Society of Health System Pharmacists Innovative Practice award, for a program in which pharmacists monitored antibiotic therapy in a community hospital. As a result, there is a higher cure rate with infection and a lower failure rate—these were statistically significant differences—and a significant trend toward appropriate therapy when involved with patient care according to Ms. Kasbekar. The hospital viewed it as a huge success because in the initial cost evaluation, it had expected to save $150,000, but ended up saving $500,000.

Her plans for the immediate future include making those awards work overtime for the community. “The award brought us a lot of attention, and we can use it to bring the issues of global resistance out in the community,” she says. “We need to get out to the HMOs and give them strict formularies so we can decrease antibiotic associative resistance.”

A Force More Powerful: A Century of Nonviolent Conflict

A premier screening of the documentary film ""A Force More Powerful, a Century of Nonviolent Conflict"" was held on December 9, 1999 at a function organized by the US Institute of Peace, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International in Washington D.C. The Mayor of Washington D.C., Anthony Williams, and Ambassador of India to US, Mr. Naresh Chandra joined the Washington-based Filmmaker, Steve York and the Chairman of the Santa Monica Pictures L.L.C., Peter Ackerman.

The feature length documentary presents one of the 20th century's most important and inspiring stories — the victory of nonviolent power over oppression and authoritarian rule. It explores situations in which freedom was achieved through the philosophy and methods developed by Mahatma Gandhi of India. The first segment documents Gandhi's fight for India's independence from British rule and includes powerful episodes from history where nonviolence overcame injustice, discrimination and authoritarianism. The film then focuses on 1959 Nashville protests led by Rev. James Lawson who studied Gandhi's philosophy and method in India. The final segment of the film concerns Mkhuseli Jack, one of the most prominent leaders in South Africa whose inspired boycotts hastened the end of apartheid in that country.

The film brings to the fore the originality, courage and moral superiority of the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi, the leading personality of the 20th century. In his own words, nonviolence became ""a priceless and matchless weapon. Those who wield are strangers to disappointment and defeat."" The greatness of these ideas was clearly a powerful force behind the making of the film. In the words of Producer-Director-Writer Steve York, ""when I was in India, I walked along the dusty road leading to the beach where Gandhi broke the salt law. It looks about the same as it did in 1930. The place is nothing special, it's what Gandhi did there that's remarkable..."". Several speakers paid tributes to Gandhi identifying him as the Man of the Century."
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000127.jpg,"India-U.S. Relations: A Vision for the 21st Century

At the dawn of a new century, President Clinton and Prime Minister Vajpayee resolve to create a closer and qualitatively new relationship between the United States and India.

We are two of the world's largest democracies. We are nations forged from many traditions and faiths, proving year after year that diversity is our strength. From vastly different origins and experiences, we have come to the same conclusions: that freedom and democracy are the strongest bases for both peace and prosperity, and that they are universal aspirations, constrained neither by culture nor levels of economic development.

There have been times in the past when our relationship drifted without a steady course. As we now look towards the future, we are convinced that it is time to chart a new and purposeful direction in our relationship.

Globalization is erasing boundaries and building networks between nations and peoples, economies and cultures. The world is increasingly coming together around the democratic ideals India and the United States have long championed and lived by.

Together, we represent a fifth of the world's people, more than a quarter of the world's economy. We have built creative, entrepreneurial societies. We are leaders in the information age. The currents of commerce and culture that link our societies run strong and deep. In many ways, the character of the 21st century world will depend on the success of our cooperation for peace, prosperity, democracy and freedom.

That presents us with an opportunity, but also a profound responsibility to work together. Our partnership of shared ideals leads us to seek a natural partnership of shared endeavors.

In the new century, India and the United States will be partners in peace, with a common interest in complementary responsibility for ensuring regional and international security. We will engage in regular consultations on, and work together for, strategic stability in Asia and beyond. We will bolster joint efforts to counter terrorism and meet other challenges to regional peace. We will strengthen the international security system, including in the United Nations, and support the United Nations in its peace-keeping efforts. We acknowledge that tensions in South Asia can only be resolved by the nations of South Asia. India is committed to enhancing cooperation, peace and stability in the region.

India and the United States share a commitment to reducing and ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons, but we have not always agreed on how to reach this common goal. The United States believes India should forgo nuclear weapons. India believes that it needs to maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent in keeping with its own assessment of its security needs. Nonetheless, India and the U.S. are prepared to work together to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. To this end, we will persist with and build upon the productive bilateral dialogue already underway.

We reaffirm our respective voluntary commitments to forgo further nuclear explosive tests. We will work together and with others for an early commencement of negotiations on a treaty to end the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. We have both shown strong commitments to export controls, and will continue to strengthen them. We will work together to prevent the spread of dangerous technologies. We are committed to build confidence and reduce the chances of miscalculation. We will pursue our security needs in a restrained and responsible manner, and will not engage in nuclear and missile arms races. We will seek to narrow our"

economic, scientific and technological assistance that, among others, made the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s possible.

The end of the Cold War in the 1990s, coinciding with the liberalization of the Indian economy, saw a steady improvement in India-US relations with the Clinton Administration identifying India as one of the 10 major emerging markets. The last few years have witnessed a number of high-level exchanges, unprecedented in the history of bilateral relations, as well as a commencement of a ""strategic dialogue"", which were expected to culminate in a US Presidential visit to India in 1998.

The nuclear tests of May 1998 caused a temporary setback to the relationship. The US imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions under the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act (Glenn Amendment) besides terminating all forms of defense cooperation, including IMET. The US has, nonetheless, recognized the need to engage India in an effort to address its own concerns and to normalize relations.

Following ten rounds of talks from June 1998 between External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,

normalcy has been restored to the bilateral relationship, although some issues still remain to be resolved. President Clinton's forthcoming visit to India is an opportunity for both countries to build a new relationship between the world's two largest democracies in the 21st century based on their common strengths, values and interests.

Bilateral trade between the two countries has exceeded US $12 billion in 1999. There was a decline in FDI inflows from the US in 1998 (US $349 million as against US $719 million in 1997), which could be attributed not only to the impact of the economic sanctions on the general investment climate in India, but also to the South East Asian turmoil and the slowdown in the Indian economy. There was an upward trend in 1999, with FDI inflows in the first four months of the year itself amounting to US$ 186 million. The waiver of sanctions and the opening up of the insurance sector in India are likely to further increase FDI inflows into India in the near future.

Some of the areas in which the two countries are well placed to launch a new era of cooperation are science and technology, energy, environment, infrastructure development and information technology. Apart from the two governments, cooperation is also being intensified between professional societies and business and trade representatives of the two countries.

Globally, India has to move purposefully towards realizing its true dimensions - as a major civilisational state, with its own strategic autonomy and strategic space, born out of its economic and political interaction with other countries particularly in the Asia-Pacific com-munity. The real wealth of a nation is its people. History and paucity of appropriate resources prevented us from participating in the economic transformations brought about since the Industrial Revolution. In 1820, Asia contributed 58 per cent of the World GDP; today it is at 37 per cent; by 2020, expectations are that it could regain the level of 200 years ago. India has a signal role to play in the coming decades. With our democratic institutions, a large skilled manpower base, geographic loca-tion, we must ensure that India rides the crest of this wave.

That is the solemn message of Kargil to the nation and to the world. I close with the poignant words of the memorial at Kohima, that stands tall and proud on a hill, commemorating those who fell in another war:
""When you go home
Tell them of us
And say
For your Tomorrow We gave our Today.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Embassy Diary:

With approvals from several US authorities in hand, the plans for the construction of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial are now in their final stages. The memorial, which will be installed on Massachusetts Avenue opposite the Embassy, will have a statue of the Father of the Nation as its centerpiece.

The Embassy worked on all fronts to put forward India's position during the Kargil crisis to US policy makers both in the US Congress and in the Administration. The Ambassador, Deputy Chief of Mission and other senior officials also met prominent members of think tanks and the US media to keep them up-to-date on developments. Embassy's website www.indianembassy.org was also usefully employed to project India's viewpoints during the Kargil crisis.

The Embassy continued its efforts to reach out to different sections of the United States public as well as the Indian American community. The Ambassador and the Deputy Chief of Mission sent out letters at regular intervals to apprise the community of current developments in Indo-US relations and Government of India's policies. They and other officers also participated in several community functions both in Washington and other parts of the country including the Indo-American Friendship Council's annual meeting in Washington, Independence Day festivities and Parade in Chicago, the 17th Annual American Association of the Physicians of India's origin, San Francisco, JAINA Convention, Philadelphia besides several other functions.

The Embassy continued its interaction with all sections of the media including major television networks. Ambassador Naresh Chandra spoke at a function at National Press Club on May 20 and Deputy Chief of Mission Mr. T.P. Sreenivasan spoke at another function organized at the National Press Club on August 9.

The Embassy cooperated with the Smithsonian Institution in organizing a six part lecture series on Rajasthan, with the National Museum for Women in Arts to present the creation of Indian women, and with the John Hopkins Institute and the Smithsonian Institute for their programme on religion and traditions in India."

gently so as to ensure that the multilateral trading system results in mutual benefits for all countries.

India was also able to moderate the wording on global coherence as much as 'coherence' has been diluted to 'cooperation' in the critical portions of the UNCTAD-X Declaration and Plan of Action. India feels that strengthened 'coherence' between WTO and the UN organizations may lead to increased cross conditionsities, which may narrow down our policy options for development. Thus our success in diluting the coherence brief in UNCTAD is significant.

(b) Under the second track of post-Seattle follow up Government has held consultations to appraise the situation arising out of the failure of the Seattle Ministerial Conference to reach consensus on major issues.

A meeting of the Advisory Committee on International Trade was convened on February 3, 2000 to apprise the Committee of the important developments at and immediately after Seattle and seek the Committee's advice on the way forward. The gist of the Committee's advice to Government has been to ask Government to review the implementation issues and prioritise those which are of core interest; to ensure that our implementation demands are properly attuned to our autonomous programme of domestic economic liberalisation; to evolve a suitable response to a situation where even some of the developing countries are willing to accept some watered down version of a group on trade and labour in association with the WTO; and evolve our stand on environment so that we don't appear to be against protection of environment; to give adequate publicity to our positive record of adherence to ILO conventions and ongoing efforts for implementation of core labour standards; and to formulate a national consensus on biotechnology etc.

(c) The third strand of our post-Seattle approach has been to participate actively in the meetings of the General Council of the WTO and its subsidiary bodies to continue to emphasise the areas of our concern. India has participated actively in the General Council meetings held post-Seattle on December 17, 1999 and on February 2, 7 & 29, 2000."

The 'risk' which Mr. Vajpayee took in visiting Lahore, as mentioned by Mr Clinton, is noteworthy in this context. It showed that India was ready to go the extra mile to resolve differences. But, as soon as the situation showed signs of improvement, there were attempts to sabotage the painstaking efforts, as Mr. Vajpayee pointed out in the joint press conference with the U.S. President. The 'horrible' events in Kashmir the previous night, in Mr. Clinton's words, can possibly be seen as such a cynical ploy by mercenaries to whom human lives count for nothing. — Hindustan Times, March 22, 2000 A Watershed? The signing of the document, India-U.S. Relations: A Vision for the 21st Century by the Prime Minister of India, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and President Bill Clinton of the United States, is an event of far-reaching significance. It marks the remarkable transformation that has come upon the relations between the two countries since the tension and suspicion of the Cold War days. The document, which is most comprehensive and covers almost every possible area in which India and the U.S. can interact is a clear indication of the depth and intensity of the engagement sought by both sides. — The Pioneer, March 22, 2000 Man of the moment Even as Bill Clinton's visit continues to inspire rhetorical flourishes — 'the beginning of a new voyage in a new century', as Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told Parliament on Wednesday — there is little doubt that the relaxed personal style of the American President has won him as many admirers in this country as has the seeming tilt in the U.S. policy towards India under him. — Hindustan Times, March 23, 2000 Upswing in Indo-U.S. relations The U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton's visit to India has inaugurated what could be a brighter and more promising chapter in the history of the relationship between India and the United States which has for long been a troubled and difficult one. The first American President to visit India in two decades, Mr. Clinton's interactions with the political leadership in New Delhi resulted in a decision to upgrade and intensify the diplomatic contacts between both sides — regular summit meetings between the Indian Prime Minister and the U.S. President, an annual foreign policy dialogue at the level of the Minister for External Affairs and the U.S. Secretary of State and other regular foreign policy consultations. The decision to institutionalise the Indo-U.S. dialogue and to create an 'architecture' of high-level consultations, marks an acknowledgment on both sides, particularly the U.S., of the strategic utility of deepening the engagement between the two countries that were clearly until now conforming to the description of 'estranged democracies'. — The Hindu, March 23, 2000 Clinton in Middle India To India of the silent majority, the Clinton visit is both an engaging spectacle (to be watched after office hours on TV) and serious business because it marks the beginning of a major change in mutual relations where the wasted opportunities may be set right. In doing so, India will guard its own interests and America its own, as always. Only this time, there seems every possibility of the two sets of interests converging because of the post-Cold War ground realities which were earlier absent. There is nothing artificial or forced, therefore, about the new warmth in Indo-US ties. It is the natural outcome of events such as the demise of communism and the rise of Islamic terrorism. — Hindustan Times, March 25, 2000 See INDIAN PRESS MONITOR, Page 12"
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000083.jpg,"Suo Motu Statement by Shri Jaswant Singh, Minister of External Affairs in Parliament on the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference May 9, 2000

The sixth Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference is currently taking place in New York. Consistent with our policy India is not attending the Conference.

Since independence India has been a strong proponent of global nuclear disarmament and has taken numerous initiatives towards this objective. We remain committed to nuclear non-proliferation. India holds that genuine and lasting non-proliferation can only be achieved through agreements that are based upon equality and non-discrimination, for only these can contribute to global peace and stability.

In 1995, the NPT was extended indefinitely and unconditionally. Hon'ble Members would be aware that 187 countries are today parties to the NPT. The proponents of NPT cite these developments as evidence of NPT's success; yet, it is also clear that there exist strong differences even among the NPT States Parties. Three of the five Review Conferences held so far failed to reach any agreement on a final document. The non-nuclear weapon States Parties to the NPT have increasingly felt left down by the lack of progress on disarmament, as well as non-compliance with the basic provisions of the Treaty.

The nuclear weapon States Parties to the NPT and their allies have not diminished the role of nuclear weapons in their respective or collective security calculus; on the contrary, new doctrines and justifications have been developed.

NATO's new strategic concept, announced last year, ten years after the end of the Cold War, goes to re-emphasising a need for the continued retention of nuclear weapons. The nuclear weapons sharing arrangements within NATO also pose serious questions about compliance. Such developments are clear and continuing violations of the provisions of the NPT. This the NPT community has been unable to discuss, let alone deal with.

One of the basic obligations of the nuclear-weapon-states under the NPT was to prevent further proliferation. The record on this has also not been satisfactory. The nuclear-weapon-states have either been active collaborators in or silent spectators to continuing proliferation, including exports of nuclear weapon related components and technologies.

After more than three decades, the nuclear weapon States Parties to the NPT remain to be persuaded to begin any kind of collective, meaningful negotiations aimed at global nuclear disarmament. These countries were expected to display a special responsibility to implement Article VI; instead, this special responsibility today appears to be arrogated as a permanent special right to possess nuclear weapons and only for their exclusive security.

India is a nuclear weapon state. Though not a party to the NPT, India's policies have been consistent with the key provisions of NPT that apply to nuclear weapon states. These provisions are contained in Articles I, III and VI. Article I obliges a nuclear weapon state not to transfer nuclear weapons to any other country or assist any other country to acquire them and India's record on non-proliferation has been impeccable. Article III requires a party to the Treaty to provide nuclear materials and related equipment to any other country only under safeguards; India's exports of such materials have always been under safeguards. Article VI commits the parties to pursue negotiations to bring about eventual global nuclear disarmament. It needs to be emphasised that India today is the only nuclear weapon state that remains committed to commencing negotiations for a Nuclear Weapons Convention, in order to bring about a nuclear-weapon-free-world, the very objective envisaged in Article VI of the NPT.

After the tests undertaken by India in May, 1998, we have declared that India shall only maintain a minimum credible deterrent and not engage in any arms race. The role of India's nuclear weapons is defensive; accordingly, India has announced a policy of no-first-use and a policy of non-use against non-nuclear weapon states. In fact, this meets the demand of unqualif-ied negative security assurances, raised by the large majority of non-nuclear weapon states to ensure their security. India has also indicated readiness to provide requisite assurances to the nuclear-weapon-free-zones in existence or those being negotiated. We have also taken new initiatives calling for de-alerting of nuclear weapons as a means of reducing the risk of"

Following is a chronology of events

Indian Airlines Flight 814 takes off from Kathmandu at 1615 (IST) hours on December 24, 1999.

The five armed hijackers make the pilot divert the plane over Lucknow and head for Lahore in Pakistan.

The Lahore airport authorities refuse to permit the aircraft to land, forcing it to head back to Amritsar, India.

The plane lands at Amritsar where the hijackers demand that the aircraft be refueled. The airport is sealed off.

The airport authorities make preparations for refueling but the aircraft needs to be brought closer to the tank.

The hijackers make the aircraft take off for Lahore despite short runway available and very low fuel levels. They fatally stab one passenger, Mr. Katyal and threaten to kill more people.

India persuades the Pakistani authorities to permit the aircraft to land at Lahore.

Lahore airport is sealed off.

The aircraft nearly crash lands and is surrounded by Pakistani commandos.

It is refueled at hijacker's request and headed for Kabul. Pakistani authorities refuse permission for the bleeding Mr. Katyal to come of the plane, despite willingness of the hijackers.

Because of the lack of night-landing facilities in Kabul, and later, at Kandahar, the plane is diverted towards Dubai.

It finally lands at the Al-Minhat air force base, UAE. The hijackers demand food, medicines and a stepladder since none is available.

The hijackers release 25 passengers, and allow the body of Mr. Katyal to be released to the UAE authorities.

Early on December 25, 1999 morning, the flight takes off from Dubai for Afghanistan. At 0855 hours, it lands at Kandahar.

Senior Indian officials open talks with the hijackers to secure the release of hostages.

Hijackers demand release of 35 other jailed terrorists besides Mohammad Masood Azhar and US $200 million for the release of 154 hostages.

Later hijackers drop their demands for a $200 million ransom and the exhumed remains of Afghan terrorist Sajjad Afghani.

Passengers released on December 31, 1999 after Government of India releases 3 terrorists with known links to Harkat ul-Ansar. Hijackers head towards Pakistan.

On the basis of radio intercepts and collected evidence, the Government of India identifies the hijackers as Pakistani nationals with links to ISI, an intelligence organization of the Pakistan Government.

/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000030.jpg,"The intruder was given a further opportunity to prove his bona fides. This was done through an accepted signalling system. This involves two aircraft moving to the side of the intruding aircraft, conveying a visual signal i.e. wiggling of wings and leftward movement. These are universally recognised signals conveying that intruder is in our airspace, and asking him to follow and land as well as indicating to him the place he should land. The intruder is expected to respond indicating that the landing place conveyed to his is practical. This effort to communicate with him was sustained, and every opportunity was given to him to respond and land peacefully. Instead, he not only disregarded our aircraft signals, but also turned towards the intercept aircraft in an aggressive, evasive movement. Given the unusual movements of the intruder over our territory, already monitored and described above and his subsequent conduct after giving him the opportunity to land safely, our Air Force could have reached no conclusion other than this was a hostile military operation, which required counter-action.

There is no weakness in these rules of engagement. What they require is that both sides must observe them honestly. If one side decides to break them the system becomes unworkable, regardless of how reinforced and foolproof it might be.

Pak conduct in this matter is a major violation of an important CBM. The 1991 Agreement is one of the 4 CBMs put in place from 1998 onwards, at our instance. We are committed to observance of CBMs.

The Pak combat aircraft was hit on its left engine which caught fire. The indication is that, as a result it started moving in a forward arc even though damaged. Apparently in its attempt to head back into Pak airspace, it cut an arc across the border into Pakistan, and then seems to have impacted very near the border itself. As it moved, it would also have started breaking up which is why there has been wreckage found in both India and Pakistan. An aircraft such as this does not fall vertically but follows a trajectory based on constantly changing aerodynamics. This explains why there are pieces of wreckage that we have retrieved, and others that Pakistan has been displaying on TV.

Precise location of pieces of wreckage in itself cannot in this instance, be correlated categorically with the movement of the aircraft on its flight path before it was hit. It is natural for wreckage to scatter and this does not in any way impinge on the basic issue that aircraft was in Indian airspace as indicated above.

The crucial question is what then prevented the Pak aircraft from proving its bona fides when it had every opportunity to do so under the rules of engagement of which they are fully aware.

The question again arises if the aircraft was indeed engaged on an innocent, routine mission, why it could not prove this by complying with the mutually accepted procedures of engagement when every opportunity was given to it.

The part of the border in Kutch where there is a divergence in interpretation of the boundary is the mouth of the Sir Creek, which is somewhat removed from the place where the air intrusions occurred. The essential point is that at one sector of the border where three intrusions took place, the boundary alignment is not in question at all. Therefore it cannot in anyway cast doubt on air space violation. In the other sector where the single fourth intrusion took place, the divergence in interpretation of boundary demarcation is very small (350 meters at maximum) and this does not in any way detract from the fact of the air space violation.

There have been violations in different sectors of the border over the past months and years. Many of them are high-speed aircraft entering and existing in minutes. It is not possible to intercept them but they are none the less intrusions and violations of the 1991 Agreement. Some may be inadvertent. The existing mechanism i.e. the 1991 Agreement, taken together with the rules of engagement provide for fool proof handling of all these possibilities. We have taken up all major cases with Pakistan government.

Recent provocation is yet another serious undermining of what should be a common effort to reduce tensions and improve relations. It is clear that this incident was totally avoidable.

It is unfortunate that they have compounded this with yet another provocation by firing missiles at our unarmed helicopters carrying civilians (journalists) while within our airspace (on Aug 12). We did not retaliate in this instance.

We continue to operate in a larger consistent framework and vision of good neighbourly relations with Pakistan. We seek to build cooperation and confidence and resolve issues through peaceful bilateral discussions, working towards realistic solutions. The Simla Agreement provides the framework. We seek to build a stable, broad-based relationship on this basis. We will continue our initiatives as in the past, including the composite dialogue and the Lahore process. We remain committed to the Lahore process and dialogue.

The Lahore process and dialogue have been greatly undermined by Pakistan's adventureism in Kargil and by its renewed cross-border terrorism. They have the responsibility of repairing damage and restoring trust. We call on Pakistan to take concrete steps for this purpose. This would facilitate resumption of Lahore process and composite dialogue. This requires reaffirmation of inviolability and sanctity of LOC. Sponsorship of terrorism across LOC in any particular sector, is violation of LOC, as indeed of Simla Agreement and Lahore understandings. This also prevents return of trust. Hence, Pakistan must abjure instigating, sponsoring, aiding and abetting cross border terrorism."

(Continued from page 1)
to generate a better appreciation of India's security concerns. Obviously, this is possible only through a sustained, bilateral dialogue process. An understanding in this regard will restore our relationship to the pre-May 1998 position. I am also optimistic that this process of restoration will result in an acceptance of a secure, self-confident India, thus imparting a new momentum to these ties.
At the same time, there is no denying that the manner in which the cib was negotiated, particularly during the last stages, left a great deal to be desired. This led to resentment against the proposed treaty. Many in India see it as part of a discriminatory, nuclear nonproliferation regime.
The Government's commitment to nuclear non-pro-liferation remains unchanged. The priority of our meeting the country's national security concerns having been addressed, the Government believes that we now need to convey reassurance to the international community and, in this regard, desires to develop a national consensus. The need for a consensus in any democratic society is self-evident.
Thave explained this in the past to the .S. admin-istration, and they better understand this approach after their own difficulties on this issue in their Sen-ate.
There appears to be lack of clarity about signing and ratification. Can you elaborate?
Three separate decisions are required of the Government as part of adherence to any international treaty: signature, ratification and deposition of the instrument of ratification. These decisions are taken by the Cabinet. Each of them is a separate decision.
To recall a recent example, in January 1993, the Cabinet decided that India will become a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention; the decision to ratify was taken in October 1995, followed by another decision to deposit the instrument of ratification in September 1996.
In your view, how far should India go in terms of its adherence to the CTBT at this stage, particularly in light of the uncertainty about the Treaty's future created by the U.S.
Senate vote?
As I have already clarified, the process of adherence to an international treaty is a step-by-step process.
While India's decisions will be made by the Indian Government, there is no denying that this negative vote by the U.S. Senate does have a bearing on the future of this treaty. I would, therefore, consider it natural for India to also disaggregate its decision.
Is India ready to join in a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapon purposes?
We have, after the tests last year, announced our readiness to engage in multilateral negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva for a non-discriminatory and verifiable treaty to ban future production of fissile materials for nuclear weapon purposes. This decision was taken after due consid-eration, which included an assessment of timeframes for negotiations and entry into force of an FMCT. At this stage, India cannot accept a voluntary moratorium on production of fissile materials. Let me add that FMCT negotiations are a complex exercise it will be important, therefore, as we go along to constantly monitor the pace, direction and content of these negotiations.
Export controls is another element of dialogue with the U.S. What are the prospects of an understanding in this area?
India has remained committed to non-proliferation and maintains a highly effective system of export controls on sensitive and dual-use technologies and equipment. We have conveyed our willingness to strengthen this further, where necessary. In this regard, an inter-ministerial expert group has been established. I must add that we do remain greatly concerned about the fact that certain civilian pro-grammes in high technology areas such as space, remain targeted. Our participation in ad hoc export control regimes, such as Nuclear Suppliers Group and MTCR will be on the basis of equality. The U.S. does appreciate that India has a system of laws and an effective institutional mechanism to implement non proliferation-related export controls but we need to make further progress.
There is a perception in the international community that the document prepared by the National Security Advisory Board for the National Security Council is India's official nuclear doctrine. What is the status of this document?
Let me correct this perception. The National Security Advisory Board is a group of non-official strategic experts and analysts. It was tasked by the National Security Council to prepare a number of papers, including one on a possible 'Indian Nuclear Doc-trine'. This it prepared and submitted to the National Security Adviser, also releasing it publicly for a larger debate. That debate is now under way. It is"
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000075.jpg,"Excerpts from Ambassador Naresh Chandra’s chat with India Today March 27, 2000

Q: Of what consequence and importance for India was President Clinton’s visit considering that he is nothing but a lame duck President.

Naresh Chandra: The main purpose of President Clinton’s visit was to send a clear signal that both India and the U.S. are ready and committed to forge a new relationship in the 21st century. The summit meeting has been very successful and laid the foundation for carrying forward meaningful dialogue and to improve cooperation in vital areas over a broad range. These institutional arrangements will survive a change of government, which is in any case a regular feature in democracies. Of course the personal contributions of the two leaders will remain to serve the interlocutors on both sides in the future.

Q: Sir, how do you analyze the failure of Indian diplomacy to persuade the US President not to visit Pakistan. It does seem that even now the Indian lobbying in Washington is not very efficient as compared with Pakistan.

Naresh Chandra: The approach of the government of India has been very much distorted in some sections of the press. You’ll be glad to know that our invitation to the U.S. President was unconditional. It was our duty to inform the U.S. side in advance about the adverse reaction in India to a visit to Pakistan at this time, because of all that had happened in 1999 like the Kargil crisis, the military takeover and the Indian Airlines plane hijack. We always said this is a decision for the US President to take and the warmth and the scale of our reception would not be affected if he decided to visit Pakistan. You should also know that leading newspapers expressed opinions against the Pakistan visit. Opinion in the US, among experts, was divided. Many leading Americans said that a visit to a military regime would somewhat tarnish America’s image as a champion of democracy and tend to legitimize the military government in Pakistan. Indian diplomacy did not fail. In fact Indian diplomacy alerted the U.S. administration of possible dangers; that is why the U.S. President and official spokesmen were able to quickly rebut Islamabad’s claim that the visit legitimized the military government’s stand. Our diplomatic efforts must have been effective as can be seen from the statements made by the President and his National Security Advisor on this subject.

Q: Will signing CTBT really make any difference in Indo-US ties?

Naresh Chandra: It is evident that signing the CTBT will narrow down differences that we have on Non-proliferation issues. However, the chief criterion for taking a decision one way or the other would be on the basis of a consensus and in the context of what is in the national security interests of the people of India.

Q: Now that Mr. Clinton has had a very successful visit to India, what specific steps will our embassy and consulates take to get NRIs involved in building a better understanding between the Congress and India on Kashmir and also between US citizens and India on Kashmir. Many still do not have a proper appreciation of the problems faced by India in solving the Kashmir problem. There should be a strategic plan drawn by the embassy for this purpose.

Naresh Chandra: The embassy and consulates have been working very closely with Indian Americans and this has resulted in a greater understanding of the Jammu and Kashmir issue. I agree that more needs to be done but you should note that a very large number of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate have given statements and written letters to the U.S. President supporting India’s case and highlighting the irresponsible actions of Pak agencies in supporting cross-border terrorism and fundamentalist militant activity. The strategic plan exists and it is drawn up at the government of India level to be followed and implemented by Indian missions abroad, including the embassy at Washington, DC.

Q: Do you think India and Pakistan will sit and talk on Kashmir? If Pakistan stops sending in armed militants, as required by India for talks, what is there to talk about Kashmir, there will be peace as such.

Naresh Chandra: The Simla agreement of 1972 and the Lahore declaration of 1999 provide for a bilateral dialogue to resolve all issues including Jammu and Kashmir. India’s stand is that for the dialogue to be meaningful, the conditions essential to progress and constructive dialogue should be present. Aiding and abetting terrorist and militant activity along-with vicious propaganda are not conducive to holding a meaningful dialogue. This is common sense. What India is seeking is not a set of pre-conditions, but the building up of a helpful atmosphere. This requires the ground situation to improve and for Pakistan and its agencies to live up to its obligations under the Simla agreement and the Lahore declaration. I do not agree with you that if peace comes there would be nothing to talk about. On the contrary there are a number of issues on which we can hopefully make progress and resolve issues, for example the Siachen dispute, the Tulbul navigation project and the better and less costly management of the Line of Control and international border. Windows of opportunity would also open for cooperation in Energy and Environment, Information Technology, Business and Trade. We would also like to improve travel facilities between India and Pakistan to reduce the difficulties faced by travelers, particularly where members of the same family are living on both sides of the border."

India's Ambassador to the U.S., Mr. Naresh Chandra, Secretary (Economic affairs), Dr. E. A. S. Sarma, the Indian Executive Directors on the Boards of the World Bank and the I.M.F., Assistant Secretary in the U.S. Department of Treasury and the U.S. Executive Director of the World Bank were among those present at the signing. The Forum is part of the broader economic and commercial dialogue between the two countries envisaged in the ""Vision Statement"" issued by Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Clinton during the U.S. President's recent visit to India. The objective of the Forum is to strengthen the financial and economic relationship between India and the United States through regular government-to-government meetings of economic policy makers. The Forum is to be headed by the Indian Finance Minister and the U.S. Treasury Secretary who are expected to meet on an annual basis. These meetings are to be supplemented by sub-Cabinet level meetings of officials of the two governments and will involve, as appropriate, the participation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Council of Economic Advisors and, on the Indian side, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and the Reserve Bank of India. The sub-cabinet level meetings are expected to focus on the strengthening and development of financial services through mutual exchange of experiences on issues relating to capital markets in the two countries and macro-economic and investment issues such as, structural reform, fiscal and monetary policies, and bilateral trade issues. After the signing ceremony, the two sides held bilateral discussions in which the subject of the first meeting of the Forum was also raised. It was agreed that this meeting may be held prior to the next meeting of the Heads of Government envisaged in the Vision Statement. A Season for Nonviolence Bronze busts of Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi were unveiled at a colorful ceremony at Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Morehouse College, Atlanta on April 2, 2000. The ceremony also marked the founding of the Mahatma Gandhi's Center for the study of peace and nonviolence. The function which marked the closing of ""A Season for Nonviolence"", a campaign that highlighted the philosophies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., was organized by the Morehouse College in cooperation with the Indian American community of Atlanta. Founded in 1867 as the Augusta Institute in Augusta, Georgia, Morehouse College is the nation's only private, historically black liberal arts college enrolls approximately 3,000 students. More than 1500 people including Dr. Coretta Scott King, Dr. Arun Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Mayor of Atlanta, President of Morehouse College, Mr. Rinzling Wangdi, Consul General of India at Houston, Mr. Anil Chowdhry, Minister (Community Affairs), Embassy of India, Washington, D.C. and Indian American community leaders from Atlanta, attended the ceremony. A 100-member voice choir specially flown in from Los Angeles for the occasion sang hymns specially composed for the occasion. The event supported the unanimous declaration of the UN General Assembly of November 1998, which called for a Decade of Peace and Nonviolence for the children of the world beginning with the new millennium."

His recent widely acclaimed biography, American in Khadi, shows how there has always been a natural affinity between India and America. Friends, what is it about Gandhiji that makes him a man not just of the past, but equally of the present and the future?
What is it about him that makes him not just an Indian, but a man who belonged to the whole humanity?
The answer to these questions is obvious: The universality of the man. And the immorality of his message.
What is more, Gandhiji lived his own message. As he himself famously put it, ""My life is my message"".
It is the message of truth and non-violence.
Of brotherhood of all human beings.
Of cooperation among Equally, it is the message of tolerance and respect for diversity, which are the basic tenets of democracy. Gandhiji saw both these tenets as the art and science of mobilising the physical, economic and spiritual resources of all sections of the people in the service of the common good. It is the proud privilege of both India and the United States that out two countries are models — one in the East and the other in the West — of democracy as well as unity in diversity. We both cherish, preserve and promote universal human rights such as freedom of speech, political choice and religious belief. These are universal values that form the foundation of more tolerant and compassionate societies, a more non-violent world free from tensions and fear. They form the foundation of a world where the liberty of people living in open societies is not threatened by extremism and terrorism. These are values enshrined in the American and Indian Constitutions and handed down to us by great men like Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. It is not a coincidence that all three of them fell to the bullets of assassins. Inspired by the Mahatma, we believe that non-violence requires faith in God and faith in man. Hence, we remain hopeful of a world where the conscience of humanity will never allow forces of bigotry and violence to succeed. Gandhiji’s statue here in the heart of Washington will be a symbol of the triumph of the human spirit against oppression, just as the Statue of Liberty in the New York has been the beacon of freedom, for the whole world. Distinguished guests, Today is the penultimate day of my visit to this great country. It has been a very satisfying and fruitful visit. I thank President Clinton for the enormous personal commitment he has brought to bear on the success of the Indo-American dialogue. Just as his visit to India earlier this year was a memorable one for him, my own visit to America now has been equally momentous. See VAJPAYEE’S AFTER DEDICATION SPEECH, Page 10"

The bilateral meeting was organized on the margins of the conference of ‘Communities of Democracies’ (CD). CD is a new initiative organized by a number of countries. India was one of the seven countries of the convening group of CD, which met prior to the conference in order to prepare a draft declaration, which could be released on the conclusion of the conference. CD is not an institutionalized grouping against anybody but a joint initiative taken to exchange views and share experiences on how to strengthen democracy and democratic practices.

The meeting between External Affairs Minister and U.S. Secretary of State lasted for an hour. During the meeting discussions were held on the modalities of CD.

The U.S. Secretary of State, Madeline Albright reiterated a very positive assessment of U.S. President’s visit to India in March this year. Ms. Albright also reiterated U.S. President’s invitation to our Prime Minister for a return visit.

The return visit by our Prime Minister is expected to take place in September this year. The details are being worked out and would be announced subsequently.

External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh raised the question of Indian UN peacekeepers in Sierra Leone and our concerns on this issue. Incidentally, the following day External Affairs Minister was to meet UN Secretary General to have discussions on this issue. Ms. Albright expressed her willingness to join him for this meeting and reiterate US concerns. The next day, both the leaders jointly met UN Secretary General.

As a result of consistent and continuing diplomatic efforts, 21 of the Indian soldiers in relatively more difficult situations have been released. This is a good development. India also appreciates Ms. Albright’s decision to join External Affairs Minister for his meeting with UNSG.

The discussions also took place on bilateral issues including nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. Indian position regarding CTBT has been articulated by PM i.e. “We are preparing a national consensus in this matter and efforts would be continued in the coming months in this direction”."
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000084.jpg,"STATEMENT

(Continued from page 2)

The NPT community needs to understand that India cannot join the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. Statements by NPT States Parties about India rolling back its nuclear programme are mere div- versions to prevent focussed attention on the basic goals of the NPT.

India's commitment to global nuclear disarmament and lasting non-proliferation remains undiluted. While willing to commence negotiations on Nuclear Weapons Convention, India also remains ready to participate in agreed and irreversible steps to prepare the ground for such negotiations. A global no-first-use agreement and a non-use agreement against non-nuclear weapon states would meet the longstanding requirement for legally binding negative security assurances and assurances to nuclear-weapon-free zones. Another positive development would be a commitment by nuclear weapon states not to deploy nuclear weapons outside their own national territories. Nuclear weapon states also need to take steps to lower the alert status, through gradual de-alerting actions, consistent with policies of no-first-use and the defensive role of nuclear weapons. Tactical weapons that lend themselves to war fighting roles need to be eliminated. These would be some positive and concrete steps in the right direction.

India has been a responsible member of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and will continue to take initiatives and work with like-minded countries to bring about stable, genuine and lasting non-proliferation, thus leading to a nuclear-weapon-free-world.

Information on drought-hit areas and relief activities

/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000045.jpg,"ECONOMIC NEWS UPDATES Government considering proposal to grant visa on arrival to tourists The government is considering a proposal to grant visa on arrival to tourists from certain countries according to a top tourism ministry official. ""Tourism ministry has sent proposal to home ministry for granting visa to tourists when they arrive at airports,"" Tourism Secretary M. P. Bezbaruah said. Facility to grant such visa to tourists from certain countries works on a reciprocal basis and we have not specified the countries for which such facility should be extended, he added. Supreme Court rejects TRAI appear against High Court stay on CPP regime The Supreme Court has dismissed a petition by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) challenging the Delhi High Court stay on the implementation of free incoming calls for cellular phone users under Calling Party Pays (CPP) regime. ""We do not think it is appropriate to interfere with the order of the High Court or in the proceeding, there as the matter is still at a preliminary stage,"" a division bench comprising Justice B. N. Kirpal and Justice S. Rajendra Babu said while dismissing TRAI's petition. The TRAI through CPP had announced to provide from November one free incoming calls to cellular users but the same was challenged in the High Court by state-owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd and another public interest litigation which alleged that the MTNL was going to lose substantial revenue under the new regime. Under CPP, while the cellular phone owner on receiving a call from Public Service Telephone Network (PSTN), would pay no money whereas the PSTN user would pay Rs. 3.30 per call. Of the Rs. 3.30, MTNL would get Rs. 0.90 and the Cellular Operators would get Rs. 2.40. Under the existing arrangements, for each call made from PSTN, MTNL gets Rs. 1.10 and for receiving the call of three minutes, a cellular user would pay around Rs. 12. The High Court on October 28 had stayed the proposed CPP regime saying the TRAI order is a hostile discrimination against Department of Telecom (DoT) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL). Roadmap for credit information bureau A Reserve Bank of India (RBI), federal bank working group has suggested that a beginning should be made in setting up a Credit Information Bureau (CIB), even though the existing legal framework prohibited disclosure of information on banks' customers. The group, set up to explore the possibilities of establishing such a Bureau, has said that pending legislative amendments, CIB could operate with information relating to suit filed accounts and information on transactions on which the constituent has given consent to the bank to dis-close. The group, which submitted its report today, has also suggested the involvement of a foreign technology partner in setting up the Bureau. ""The Bureau could be set up as a company under the Companies Act, 1956 with share capital contributions from its user groups, namely commercial banks, financial institutions and non-banking finance companies,"" the report has said. The Bureau should collect both negative and positive information relating to credit, trade and financial information. This would include external borrowings on corporate and consumer retail segments such as credit facilities from banks, non-banking finance companies, as also credit cards held and indebtedness to cellular phone companies among others. The setting up of such a Bureau would entail the enactment of a master legislation to facilitate collection and sharing of information, the report said, adding that it should be technology-driven and professionally managed with mini-mun manual intervention. Government rejects state-owned PGCIL's equity expansion proposal The Indian Government has rejected a proposal of the Power Grid Corporation (PGCIL) to expand its equity by Rs. 12 billion to over Rs. 42 billion and instead advised it to sell a few of its transmission lines to meet fund requirements for new projects. ""We are not going for equity expansion of Power grid as proposed earlier. Instead we propose to generate resources for the corporation through other means,"" federal Power Minister P R Kumaramangalam said. The power ministry has identified about four to five transmission lines of Powergrid to be sold to private sector and the company would use the revenue generated from the sale for investments, Kumaramangalam said. Owing to fund constraints, PGCIL has revised lower by Rs. 20 billion its Ninth Plan Investment programs at Rs. 130 billion. As the corporation is expected to take up transmission work for some of the private power projects, it had sought government support to increase its borrowing capabilities. When contacted Powergrid Chairman and Managing Director R. P. Singh confirmed that the corporation would now sell some of its existing transmission projects instead of infusing fresh equity. ""We will sell some of our lines through the international competitive bidding route,"" Singh said but declined to give details. New civil aviation policy soon The Indian Government will soon come out with a new comprehensive Civil Aviation policy and is considering setting up more international airports in the country.

President of the United States Bill Clinton to visit India

President Clinton’s visit to India is the fourth by a US President. Earlier visits were by Presidents Dwight Eisenhower (1959), Richard Nixon (1969) and Jimmy Carter (1978). From the Indian side, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited in 1949, 1956 and 1961, President Radhakrishnan in 1963, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1966, 1971 and 1982, Prime Minister Morarji Desai in 1978, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985 and 1987 and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in 1994. President Clinton’s visit is taking place at a time of warming of relations between the two countries, and reflects the common desire of both countries to move towards a new, broad-based, forward-looking, politically constructive and economically productive partnership. The threat of terrorism faced by both countries from the same source has added a new dimension to India-US cooperation.

India – U.S. Relations

Over five decades, the relationship between the world’s two largest democracies has witnessed periods of ups and downs. Natural affinities between the two countries, characterized by pluralistic and open societies, common language, good track records of democracy and common commitment to the rule of law and basic freedoms, did not yield the desired results because of differing positions during the Cold War.

Successive American Administrations concerned with the need to contain communism did not view India’s leadership of the Non-aligned Movement very favorably. The US alliance with and military support to a country hostile to India was also a cause of friction. The dominance of the state sector in the Indian economy was viewed in the US as inefficient and wasteful, and detrimental to its own interests. The Indian economy nevertheless benefited considerably during this period from US food aid (PL-480) and"

Fellow citizens, Friends,

On the eve of the 52nd anniversary of India's Independence, I have great pleasure in extending to all fellow citizens, whether living in India or abroad, my warm greetings and felicitations.

I send a special word of greeting and felicitation to our brave jawans and to our kisan and mazdoor brothers and sisters, who toil and sweat from dawn to dusk and keep our country going.

I would like, this year, to convey the boundless admiration and gratitude of the nation to our Defence and Para-military Forces. It is the death-defying courage of our young men, hailing from every State, and every part of India, the sons of our common folk, fighting on the bleak and hazardous heights of Kargil, Baltal and Dras that protected India's sovereignty and territorial integrity, driving the intruders from our sacred soil across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.

Tomorrow when the national tri-colour flies atop the ramparts of the historic Red Fort and over a multitude of humble dwellings across the land, it will flutter in salute to the flower of our youth who sacrificed everything to preserve the honour of our flag. We must resolve now that their sacrifice does not go in vain.

Years ago, our First Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had noted a common failing of our country and observed that ""the basic fact remains that we have yet to develop as a unified nation... Under some calamity or external danger, we may well unite. When the immediate danger is removed, we fall back into our respective shells and lose the sense of the whole. We try to get out of these shells and then, something happens that lays bare our inner urns and failings. Whether it is provincialism or caste, we still live in a tribal age"". Kargil has shaken us out of our narrow shells and forged a new national unity in the crucible of the common danger suddenly imposed on us. Friends, we hear voices from the other side threatening more Kargils Continued on page 6"

India's economic reforms have generated a trade momentum between India and the U.S. that grows every year. Starting in 1991, India has carried out sweeping changes in its national economic policies to stimulate domestic and foreign investment in many sectors of the country's economy. The effect on trade and investment relations with the United States has been profound.

The U.S. is now not only the largest investor country in India, it is also India's largest trading partner.

The trade between the two countries in 1999 totaled US $ 12.79 billion reflecting an increase of nearly 100% since 1992.

Growth Rate

India's exports to the U.S. have been growing since 1992 at an average rate of 13.7% in dollar terms.

Imports from the USA have been fluctuating. The rate of growth declined by 0.6% in 1996, increased by 8.9% in 1997, declined by 1.96% in 1998 and grew by 4.6% in 1999.

Trade composition

India's exports to the US have been rising mainly on account of significant increases in the exports of diamonds, textiles and ready-made garments, machinery, carpets, footwear and leather products, dyes, iron and steel products, chemicals, edible fruit and nuts and spices, coffee and tea.

Six items, namely, textiles and clothing, cut and polished non-industrial diamonds, carpets, shrimp and prawn, footwear, leather goods and cashew nuts, account for about 75% of total Indian exports to the US.

The chief items imported from the U.S. at present are machinery including project items, fertilizers, aircraft and aeronautical equipment, and organic chemicals.

The true measure of our strength lies in the ability of our people to shape their destiny and to realize their aspirations for a better life. That is why the United States and India are and will be allies in the cause of democracy. We will share our experience in nurturing and strengthening democratic institutions the world over and fighting the challenge to democratic order from forces such as terrorism. We will cooperate with others to launch an international Community of Democracies this year.

The United States applauds India's success in opening its economy, its achievements in science and technology, its commitment to a new wave of economic expansion and reform, and its determination to bring the benefits of economic growth to all its people. Our nations pledge to reduce impediments to bilateral trade and investment and to expand commerce between us, especially in the emerging knowledge-based industries and high-technology areas.

We will work together to preserve stability and growth in the global economy as well. And we will join in an unrelenting battle against poverty in the world, so that the promise of a new economy is felt everywhere and no nation is left behind. That is among the fundamental challenges of our time. Opening trade and resisting protectionism are the best means for meeting it. We support an open, equitable and transparent rule-based multilateral trading system, and we will work together to strengthen it. We agree that developed countries should embrace policies that offer developing countries the opportunity to grow, because growth is the key to rising incomes and rising standards. At the same time, we share the conviction that human development also requires empowerment of people and availability of basic freedoms.

As leaders in the forefront of the new high-technology economy, we recognize that countries can achieve robust economic growth while protecting the environment and taking action to combat climate change. We will do our part to meet the global environmental challenges, including climate change and the impacts of air and water pollution on human health.

We also pledge a common effort to battle the infectious diseases that kill people and retard progress in so many countries. India is at the forefront of the global effort that has brought us to the threshold of the eradication of polio. With leadership, joint research, and application of modern science, we can and will do the same for the leading killers of our time, including AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.

We are proud of the cooperation between Indians and Americans in advancing frontiers of knowledge. But even as we unravel the mysteries of time and space, we must continue to apply our knowledge to older challenges: indicating human suffering, disease and poverty. In the past, our cooperation helped ease mass hunger in the world. In the future, it will focus as well on the development of clean energy, health, and education.

Our partnership is not an end in itself, but a means to all these ends. And it is reinforced by the ties of scholarship, commerce, and increasingly of kinship among our people. The industry, enterprise and cultural contributions of Americans of Indian heritage have enriched and enlivened both our societies.

Today, we pledge to deepen the Indian-American partnership in tangible ways, always seeking to reconcile our differences through dialogue and engagement, always seizing opportunities to advance the countless interests we have in common. As a first step, President Clinton has invited Prime Minister Vajpayee to visit Washington at a mutually convenient opportunity, and the Prime Minister has accepted that invitation. Henceforth, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of India should meet regularly to institutionalize our dialogue. We have also agreed on and separately outlined an architecture of additional high-level consultations, and of joint working groups, across the broad spectrum of areas in which we are determined to institutionalize our enhanced cooperation. And we will encourage even stronger people-to-people ties.

For India and the United States, this is a day of new beginnings. We have before us for the first time in 50 years the possibility to realize the full potential of our relationship. We will work to seize that chance, for our benefit and all those with whom we share this increasingly interdependent world.

India's energy sector has been an attractive destination for US investments. The sector offers for exploitation a vast untapped potential in hydro electricity, oil & natural gas, and coal. Although several U.S. companies have been looking at the Indian energy market closely, progress has so far been limited, given the gradual opening up of the sector. The government of India has, however, now simplified considerably the norms for entering into the exploration activities, generation, transmission and distribution of power, and captive coal mining & processing. Considering the vast demand and supply gap in the energy sector in India, there is a tremendous potential here for economic cooperation between the two countries.

During President Clinton's visit to India, the two countries signed a joint statement on cooperation on energy and environment issues, outlining a common agenda on clean energy development and environmental protection. Subsequently, a Joint Consultative Group on Clean Energy and Environment was set up, which met in Washington, DC in July. The Group looked at possible collaborative projects to develop and implement clean energy technologies with public and private sector investment. Another key area of bilateral cooperation is renewable energy. During President Clinton's visit, an MOU was signed between the Indian Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources and the United States Department of Energy.

India's Telecommunication sector, already a major recipient of U.S. investment, is expected to continue to provide substantial opportunities to U.S. investors. Though the telecommunications industry has been growing over 20% for the past few years, India has a tele density of only 2.7%. Over the next decade, more than 175 million lines are required to meet the demand of basic telecom service in India. This translates into an investment requirement of U.S. $70 billion in the basic services alone. Apart from the basic service segment, India has a subscriber base of nearly 1.6 million in cellular phone industry, 0.8 million in radio paging and 1.4 million in Internet services. These segments are growing at an average growth rate of over 50 % for the past few year. With the objective of achieving tele-density of 7 by 2005 and 15 by 2010, Government of India has ushered in several new measures to promote investment through greater private sector participation in this sector.

These measures include:

- Announcement of the New Telecom Policy 1999 (NTP)
- Simplification of the revenue sharing arrangements
- Streamlining of the functioning of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)
- Establishment of a separate Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)
- Introduction of new provisions for infrastructure sharing by telecom service providers/public utilities
- Opening of the national long distance services to private service providers
- Proposed opening of international long distance services by 2004

The government has also introduced a liberal policy for Internet Service Providers (ISP), which puts no restriction on number of Internet service providers, imposes no license fee for the first five years and allows ISPs to set up their own gateways. Keeping in view the rapid convergence of telecom, Internet and entertainment, a new comprehensive statute, to replace the Indian Telegraph Act (1885) is under way. The draft Convergence Bill envisages setting up of an independent carriage and content bureau apart from the office of the spectrum manager to bring the regulatory framework for all these services beneath one umbrella.

Another area where closer economic ties can yield mutual benefits is the infrastructure sector. The Government of India is continuously reviewing its policies to create an investor friendly environment in sectors such as roads, ports and airports. Private sector participation in Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) projects, greenfield airports and terminals and shipping berths and capacity augmentation has been initiated.

Institutionalizing the growing economic ties

The 'Vision Statement' signed by the Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Clinton envision a broader dialogue between the two countries on economic policy issues. Pursuant to this objective, Mr. Yashwant Sinha, Finance Minister of India and Mr. Lawrence Summers, U.S. Treasury Secretary, signed an agreement in April 2000 to set up the India-United States Financial and Economic Forum. The objective of the Forum is to strengthen the financial and economic relationship between the two countries through regular government-to-government meetings of the economic policy makers."

AGREED PRINCIPLES Institutional Dialogue Between the United States and India

1. During the visit of President Clinton to Delhi in March 2000, President Clinton and Prime Minister Vajpayee agreed as part of their vision for the future relationship that a regular, wide-ranging dialogue is important for achieving the goal of establishing closer and multifaceted relations between India and the United States and for the two countries to work jointly for promotion of peace and prosperity in the 21st century.

2. The President of the United States and Prime Minister of India will hold regular bilateral 'Summits' in alternating capitals or elsewhere, including on the occasions of multilateral meetings, to review bilateral relations and consult on international developments and issues. They will remain in frequent contact by telephone and through letters.

3. The two countries will also hold an Annual Foreign Policy Dialogue at the level of the Secretary of State of the United States and External Affairs Minister of India. This dialogue will be broad-based and touch upon all aspects of US-India relations, including considering the work of other groups as appropriate.

4. The two countries also consider the ongoing Dialogue on Security and Non-proliferation between the Deputy Secretary of State of the United States and External Affairs Minister of India important for improving mutual understanding on bilateral, regional and international security matters. They agreed that this dialogue should continue and take place semi-annually or as often as considered desirable by both sides. The Principles of this dialogue will establish Expert Groups on specific issues as considered desirable and appropriate.

5. Foreign Office Consultations between the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs of the United States and Foreign Secretary of India will continue. The two leaders believe that close cooperation between the two countries is a factor of stability in the politically and culturally diverse and rapidly transforming Asia. A Dialogue on Asian Security will also be conducted as part of the Foreign Office Consultations. The two sides will also stay in close touch and consult on international democracy initiatives.

6. The two leaders consider combating international terrorism as one of the most important global challenges. They expressed satisfaction at the establishment of the Joint Working Group on Counter-terrorism and its productive first meeting in February 2000. They agree that the Joint Working Group should continue to meet regularly and become an effective mechanism for the two countries to share information and intensify their cooperation in combating terrorism.

7. The two leaders see an enormous potential for enhancement of economic and business relations between the two countries in the Knowledge Age. They decided to institutionalize bilateral economic dialogue. They will keep themselves informed and follow developments in the bilateral economic dialogue closely through a high-level coordinating group. The coordinating group will be led on the U.S. side by the White House with the support of the State Department, and on the Indian side by the Prime Minister's Office with the support of the Ministry of External Affairs.

The Coordinating Group will develop a common economic agenda for and undertake preparations for the Heads of Government meetings. With broad inter-agency and inter-ministerial representations at senior official levels, it would convene regularly to facilitate close coordination on the various issues raised in the ministerial dialogues and ensure that discussions therein complement and reinforce broad economic and foreign policy objectives, including the deepening of bilateral cooperation on high technology and information technology issues."

Ms. Moynihan who first went to India in 1973 as the daughter of the then Ambassador and now U.S. Senator, Ms. Daniel P. Moynihan, is an accomplished writer, actress, singer, dancer and painter. Her multifaceted personality was in evidence not only through her reading but also through the exhibition of her paintings, which was put up at the Embassy on the occasion. Ms. Moynihan, who is a light-footed traveller currently settled in Kathmandu, best expressed her love for India when she said ""my body is Irish, my heart Tibetan, my passport is American and my soul Indian"". Ambassador Naresh Chandra, addressing the audience on the occasion, recalled the immense contributions made by Senator Daniel P. Moynihan to Indo-US relations and expressed his admiration for Ms. Moynihan's varied accomplishments in art and literature. The same audience also witnessed the amazing talent of a 20-year old Bangalore artist Raghava Kalyanaraman who displayed his series of water colours and sketches. Raghava is currently travelling in the United States and has exhibited his work in several cities. Performance of Satriya Dance: In collaboration with IDEA (Indian Dance Educator's Association) and the IMF/World Bank India Club, the Embassy organised performance of Satriya dance of Assam on May 27 at the World Bank auditorium. The dance was performed by the famous mother-daughter team of Assam, Indira P.P. Bora and Menaka. Besides the above events, the DC Film Festival (April 5-14) showed four films from India or with Indian actors: East Is East, The Terrorist, Throne of Death and Split Wide Open. Forthcoming Events: Concert by famous Dhrupad singer USTAD F. WASIFUDDIN DAGAR on June 17. He is the son and nephew of the Late DAGAR BROTHERS, Ustad N. Zahiruddin and Faiyazuddin Dagar respectively. He started his career at an early age as a soloist and also performed with his uncle in jugalbandi until 1994. He is the only heir and direct descendant in the Dagar family to perpetuate, in the 20th generation, the family vocal style of Dhrupad singing."

In parallel to the military, we also had major diplomatic challenges on our hands. A firm signal had to be conveyed to Pakistan, as also a clear and unambiguous message to the international community. Let us accept that in today’s age no conflict, least of all one between two nuclear weapons possessing states can escape global media spotlight. This was an additional and a new factor. Managing all these required a qualitatively new level of coordination, between the two wings of the South Block — the Ministries of Defence and External Affairs. This, too was achieved to demonstrable effect.

Of course, Kargil posed a challenge both to the substance of our foreign policy as also to the conduct of our diplomacy. The Prime Minister had at the very beginning directed the MEA that the true challenge lay in turning back the aggressor, in defeating all his designs, in reversing the aggression but with the maximum of restraint. The MEA had, therefore, also placed before itself the objective of protecting the international flank of the MoD; so that our operations on the ground and in the air could go on unhindered. This was also achieved in no insignificant measure. The first requirement, thus was establishing the fact of Pakistan’s intrusion and aggression. I would venture to claim that we succeeded in doing so. The next requirement was to spell our objectives with clarity, consistency and candour. This was done early, repeated whenever necessary and can be summed up, sequentially, as the following irreducible minimums.

They were:

A] Pakistan’s armed intrusion in Kargil will be evicted and its aggression vacated. All Pakistan regular troops and extremist elements under its command and control will have to withdraw. For this purpose, our armed forces will take all necessary action on our side of the Line of Control.

B] Once this intrusion has been cleared, Pakistan would need to reaffirm the inviolability and sanctity of the Line of Control.

C] Dialogue, as part of the Lahore process, which afterall, was initiated by us could only then be resumed.

Our diplomatic machinery was geared fully to convey these objectives to the international community, as being valid and worthy of support. Continuous interaction was maintained, with all the major powers, and the rest of the international community through our diplomatic missions abroad, the diplomatic community in New Delhi and through personal interaction. It is a measure of the justness of India’s cause that what I have cited above, as the irreducible minimums, found such a large community of countries standing up in support. Principally, let me repeat, it was because India’s stand was recognised as just, thus it was acted upon. I wish to also emphasize that the importance of the inviolability and sanctity of the Line of Control, for maintaining peace and tranquility, was totally accepted by the international community, and Pakistan was held as having violated this Line. Its efforts at terming it as imprecise also failed. Even more, the international community accepted India’s view that Pakistan was guilty also of transgressing the territory of trust. The international community also concurred with our assertion that Kargil was a manifestation of this medieval malevolence spilling over from Afghanistan, that these were no freedom fighters, thus there was a need to confront such impulses; in the interest not just of our region but of the larger global community.

It is noteworthy that under the leadership of the Prime Minister the Ministries of External Affairs and the Ministry of Defence worked as one, the combined synergy of which demonstrated the true power and effectiveness of the Indian State. This is, of course, how it should be. But it is a matter of satisfaction nevertheless, that this was achieved at a time of trial, a time which tests the mettle of any Government’s machinery. In this is also a lesson for the future.

There was an added dimension to our total national endeavour. It was the role of our media during Kargil operations. It was marked by exuberant enthusiasm bordering, at times, on the reckless. These young men and women of the media, who were in Kargil brought the valour of our troops, in the face of great odds, directly into the homes of our citizens. They touched our hearts and eyes with the tales of the bereaved and the families of the fallen. This was our first experience of conflict in the TV/information age. We learnt as we went along. It would be no exaggeration, therefore, to say that the role of the electronic"

MSNBC: What are the defining issues in this election, and can we expect to see substantial change from the next government?

Naresh Chandra: The main issue concerns resolving economic questions. They are in the forefront, followed by security, and law & order. Underlying all that is the strong demand by different factions for better standard of living and education and health.

Question: What are the areas in which India and US can work together when the new Government is elected next month? Is there any high optimism prevailing towards an outstanding growth in business as well as security relationship between the two biggest democracies in the world?

Naresh Chandra: We have had very good progress in our trade and investment relations since 1991-92. We are sure that this is going to be a very productive area. We have also been having a strategic dialogue at a high level. These discussions are going on and both sides have been able to narrow down differences. I think there is much better understanding now in US about India’s security concerns and the great role that India can play as a very responsible factor for peace and stability in Asia and the world.

Question: India is about to become the second nation on earth to achieve a population of 1 billion. Is India near the breaking point in terms of food production, medical care, etc.?

Naresh Chandra: I think the population needs to be properly managed and controlled. Higher population is not a goal we’re trying to achieve. But on the other hand, our food production have ensured that there is no problem with availability. There have been vast improvements in healthcare. Some states have done very well. In many areas there is need for improvement.

Question: Why can’t India draw closer to the U.S. With China growing in power and Pakistan no longer a bawk against the USSR, isn’t that in both country’s interests?

Naresh Chandra: I think from our side we have always attempted to maintain as much progress as possible in strengthening India-US relations. We should now be able to work together much more. We feel that with the dissolution of the old USSR and the opening up of the Indian market the chances are even greater. We wish for better relations with China, our great neighbour to the North. We also don’t look at Pakistan as an enemy or even as permanent adversary. We would like to cooperate with all the people in our neighbourhood. We have a large number of Indian-American families who act as a bridge between India and US. This has been extremely helpful in strengthening this relationship.

MSNBC: Do you think India will ever win a seat on the UN Security Council?

Naresh Chandra: Yes, I think it would. It’s not a case of putting up a line of argument or making a strong case. What has to be seen is India has no aggressive design on any country. It has always come forward to take part in UN peace-keeping operations. India has also proved despite its diversity it can rule according to law in a democratic manner. We have also shown that the Indian people are capable of contributing in every field of human activity including science and technology. It will be extremely odd if 1/6 of the human race with such potential and history is kept out of the Security Council in the 21st century. Without India the Security Council would not be properly representative.

MSNBC: A lot of technical folks are coming to work in the U.S. What can India do to maintain its own high-tech industry in the face of this exodus?

Naresh Chandra: There has been some exodus, but there has also been some return. Therefore, we have derived some benefits also. We have been keeping an eye on it but since we have thousands of trained and technologically qualified persons, the drain is not high enough to hurt India’s interests. With this kind of exchange of technical personnel, we have derived much mutual benefit in the growth of high-tech business between India and US.

MSNBC: Final Thoughts...

Naresh Chandra: I would like to thank all of you for your questions. We are in the process of general elections and the exercise will show that we have a strong democratic tradition. Thank you and good evening."
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000129.jpg,"India-U.S. Relations: General Overview

THE visit to India in March 2000 by U.S. President Bill Clinton provided an opportunity for both countries to open a new and qualitatively different chapter in their bilateral relations. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will be visiting the United States in mid-September, 2000. The visit is expected to build upon and consolidate the gains of President Clinton's visit to India.

Evolution of the relationship

India and U.S. are the world's two largest democracies. Natural affinities between the two countries have always existed, characterized by shared democratic values and common commitment to rule of law and basic freedoms, common language and longstanding cooperation in the economic, commercial and agricultural fields.

The end of the Cold War in 1990s, coinciding with the liberalization of the Indian economy, saw a steady improvement in India-U.S. relations with the Clinton Administration identifying India as one of the 10 major emerging markets.

President Clinton was warmly and enthusiasmically received wherever he went in India. The visit was covered extensively in the Indian audiovisual and print media. The general impression he left behind was of a genuine desire on his part to set in motion a new, forward-looking and productive partnership between the two countries.

Outcome of President Clinton's visit

The Vision Statement signed by Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Clinton provides a blueprint and sets out the direction for the new partnership in the coming years. Among the objectives to which both countries are committed are the fight against terrorism, prevention of proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery, the preservation of stability and growth in the global economy, the protection of the environment, combating infectious diseases and expanding trade especially in the emerging knowledge-based industries and high technology areas.

India and the United States have agreed on a wide ranging institutional dialogue which includes regular summit meetings between the U.S. President and the Indian Prime Minister, annual foreign policy dialogue at the level of Secretary of State and External Affairs Minister, Foreign Office consultations at senior officials level, a bilateral economic dialogue which would be coordinated by the Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of External Affairs on the Indian side and White House and State Department on the U.S. side, the establishment of a U.S.-India Financial and Economic Forum, a U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue and a U.S.-India Joint Working Group on terrorism.

Implementation of the institutional dialogue has already commenced. Prime Minister Vajpayee would be visiting Washington in September 2000. External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held a structured bilateral dialogue during the Conference ""Towards a Community of Democracies"" in Warsaw on June 26, 2000. Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering visited Delhi on May 24-25, 2000 for consultations with the Indian Foreign Secretary Lalit Mansingh.

During his visit to Washington for the World Bank/IMF meetings in April, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha and Treasury Secretary Larry Summers signed an agreement setting up an India-U.S. Financial Forum. During President Clinton's visit, the Commerce Minister Murasoli Maran and U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley signed an Agreement establishing a new commercial dialogue. A Science and Technology Forum and Joint Consultative Group on Energy and Environment have also been established.

Economic and Trade Relations

Bilateral trade between the two countries exceeded U.S. $12 billion in 1999. There was a decline in FDI inflows from the U.S. in 1998 (U.S. $349 million as against U.S. $719 million in 1997). There was an upward trend in 1999, with FDI inflows in the first four months of the year itself amounting to U.S. $186 million. The waiver of sanctions and the opening up of the insurance sector in India are likely to further increase FDI inflows into India in the near future. During a visit to Washington in April 2000, Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha and Treasury Secretary Mr. Lawrence Summers agreed on the terms of reference of an India-U.S. Financial and Economic Forum."

in the future. We have to remain united and prepared not only when war-like situations come upon us, but in normal times also, so that we are not ever again taken unawares by surprise attacks. We have to pay special attention to strengthening our armed forces, equip them with the latest weapons and force multipliers. Hitherto our expenditure on defence has been one of the lowest in the world in terms of percentage of the GDP, much lower than that of our neighbours. It is incumbent upon us to rectify this imbalance.

At the same time let us remember that a country is defended not by arms alone but by wise policies and the strength of its economy, by the justice and cohesion of its society, by the unity of its people. We are a peace-loving people by nature and tradition. We wish to live in peace with our neighbours and with the entire world. Indeed it was due to this passion for peace and our desire to avoid a fratricidal civil war, in the sub-continent, that the leaders of the Indian National Congress agreed to the partition of our motherland into India and Pakistan. It is ironic that this great sacrifice on our part and our desire to live in peace with Pakistan have not prevented unprovoked aggression and subversion against our country. In October 1947, in the very first year of our Independence, Pakistan launched an attack on us in order to wrest Jammu and Kashmir from the Indian Union. On October 29th Mahatma Gandhi said at his prayer meeting in Delhi that now that ""the Maharaja of Kashmir has announced his decision to accede to the Indian Union...and that he has taken refuge in the Indian Union, he should be protected"". Answering the question as to what should the small band of Indian soldiers sent to Srinagar by air do, Gandhiji said: ""Let them fight to the end. The job of small soldiers is to march ahead and repel the attacking enemy. They die in fighting, but never retreat"". It was this advice by the Father of the Nation and the apostle of non-violence that our brave soldiers followed in 1947 and in the recent attack on us in the Kargil area in Jammu and Kashmir.

In January 1948 Gandhiji said ""We must never, under any circumstances, treat anyone as our enemy...My reason and my heart tell me that, if for some reason, we are unable to forge friendship between Muslims and Hindus, not only here but in Pakistan and in the whole world, we shall not be able to keep our free India for long. It will pass into the hands of others"", and the freedom gained by both India and Pakistan ""will be lost"". On the awful prospect of a war between India and Pakistan he further warned, with his shrewd insight into the realpolitik of the world, that ""If you imagine to-day that we can fight and win, let me say that even before you do so, some other world power is going to swallow us up. I will swallow, in fact, both the countries.

If all my friends who are sensible people and who have spent several years with me in my work, understand that much, we would all be safe.""

While driving this basic point home Gandhiji had a clear grasp of the reality of the situation and said ""The fact is that Pakistan has invaded Kashmir. Indian troops have gone there as defenders at the express invitation of the Maharaja of the State and of Sheikh Abdullah who is the real leader of the Kashmiri people. I shall advise Pakistan and India to sit together and decide the matter. If they are interested in a settlement what is the need for an arbitrator."" Gandhiji was against the intervention of a third party or of a foreign hand as arbitrator. I recall these words today because they sum up the totality of the position which we have followed. That was our position at the Shimla Summit in 1972 and that was the position our Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee took when he traveled to Lahore this year and signed the Lahore Declaration with the Prime Minister of Pakistan. We adhere to the same friendly stand but, as we have been let down more than once in the past, it is prudent of us and it is our duty to our people to be prepared for any surprise attack on us. We have to act according to the old adage that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom as well as of peace.

Friends, as we celebrate our Independence to-morrow we recall in grateful remembrance the band of great and selfless men and women who led us in the struggle — Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Babu Rajendra Prasad, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, Sarojini Naidu and the incomparable Netaji Subash Chandra Bose, and a host of others. We recall the foot soldiers of that struggle, countless heroes and heroines who carried aloft the banner of Swaraj. Their aim was to free this ancient land so that millions of Indians sink in poverty, disease and squalor would rise and live in dignity as free human beings. We have yet to redeem the pledge they gave to our people. One third of our people still live below the poverty level, almost half of our adult population is illiterate, and more than half of the children are under-nourished. And withal our population is increasing at an alarming rate - it has been estimated that India's population would cross the one billion mark on Independence Day. The great strides we have made in economic development and in the improvement in the condition of our people has been, to some extent, negated by this population explosion. We have to gather the political and social will to stem this tide, instead of frittering away our energies in the pursuit of the politics of power and self. Great causes cry out for our urgent attention. The women of India have not yet come out of the long night of discrimination, inequality and denial of rights in which they have been living for ages. But it is gratifying to note that in different parts of India they have been rising and organizing themselves in movements for self-employment and economic empowerment. They need political support. The struggle for the basic and minimum needs of our people - for food, nutrition, health, education, drinking water and energy - remain an unfinished business. The magnitude of these problems is so immense that if we do not address them as our over-riding political, social and economic priorities, the galloping population would overwhelm us in the future. Against this background I am glad to recognize the grass-root movements cropping up in different parts of our country for supervision of development programmes by the people for education, health, employment, etc. for which Government has set apart large sums of money. The Right to information is one such grass-root movement which deserves wider popular and legislative support. Our natural environment and life sources such as air, water and land"

They reiterated their respective commitments to forgo nuclear explosive tests. India reaffirmed that, subject to its supreme national interests, it will continue its voluntary moratorium until the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) comes into effect. The United States reaffirmed its intention to work for ratification of the Treaty at the earliest possible date. The Indian government will continue efforts to develop a broad political consensus on the issue of the Treaty, with the purpose of bringing these discussions to a successful conclusion. India also reaffirmed its commitment not to block entry into force of the Treaty. India expects that all other countries, as included in Article XIV of CTBT, will adhere to this Treaty without reservations. The United States and India re iterated their support for a global treaty to halt the production of fissile material for weapons purposes, and for the earliest possible start of Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty negotiations in Geneva. The United States noted its moratorium on the production of fissile material for weapons purposes and supports a multilateral moratorium on such production pending conclusion of a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. The United States and India commended the progress made so far on export controls, and pledged to continue to strengthen them. Both countries agreed to continue their dialogue on security and nonproliferation, including on defense posture, which is designed to further narrow differences on these important issues. In combating international terrorism, the two leaders called on the international community to intensify its efforts, including at the current session of the United Nations. Noting that both India and the United States are targets of continuing terrorism, they expressed their determination to further reinforce bilateral cooperation in this area. They have agreed to hold another round of counter-terrorism consultations in New Delhi later this month, and to pursue work on a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. Finally, the two leaders also paid tribute to the contributions of the Indian-American community in providing a bridge of understanding between the two societies and in strengthening the ties of commerce and culture between the two countries. In this connection, they commended the progress of the initiative to set up a collaborative Global Institute for Science and Technology in India. The two leaders agreed to encourage people-to-people connections between the two nations, and to enlist the cooperation of all sections of their talented and diverse societies in support of that goal."

Atomic Energy

Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee dedicated the first of the twin units of the Kaiga Atomic Power Station to the nation on March 5, 2000. The unit was operating at 210 MW.

Rajasthan Atomic Power Station already has two operating units, which were reconditioned and rehabilitated in the years 1995-1998. In addition, two new units based on Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor technology were being indigenously set up. The re-actor of Unit No. 3 was made critical on December 24, 1999 and the same has been synchronized with the grid on March 10, 2000.

Civil Aviation

Disinvestment of Indian Airlines

The Government has decided to disinvest 51% of Government Equity in Indian Airlines, the national domestic carrier presently owned by the Government of India. Of the 51% of equity 26 per cent may be given to a joint venture/strategic partner. The remaining 25% would be offered to employees; financial institutions and the public. The disinvestments would be done within the framework of the Domestic Air Transport Policy.

The Ministry has concluded aviation bilateral agreements with Austria, Romania, Uzbekistan, UK, Thailand and Turkmenistan, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Oman, Qatar and Syria providing for an increase of 9680 seats per week in air-seat entitlement in each direction.

Exports exceed targeted growth rate in 1999-2000

India's exports during 1999-2000 are estimated at over U.S. $37 billion, which is 11.58% higher in dollar terms than in the previous year 1998-99. The growth in percentage terms has thus exceeded the 11.3% growth targeted for the year. In rupee terms, India's exports during 1999-2000 have increased by 14.93%. India's exports have achieved a double-digit growth after several years.

Setting up of Special Economic Zones

The Special Economic Zone (SEZ) concept has been introduced for the first time in the EXIM Policy of 2000-2001. Two such Zones are expected to come up shortly — one in Tamil Nadu and another in Gujarat. Such Zones can also be set up in the private sector or the joint sector.

Environment & Forest

The Biological Diversity Bill, 2000, tabled in Lok Sabha. The Bill seeks to provide for conservation and sustainable use of bio-diversity and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of biological resources. With a view to regulate and control noise producing and generating sources, the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 notified for prevention and control of noise pollution in the country.

Industry

Automatic approval of FDI

The Government have placed all items under the automatic approval route for foreign direct investment (FDI)/NRI and Overseas Corporate Body (OCB) investment, except for a small negative list. This move is aimed at increasing the present inflows of FDI into the country to an annual figure of U.S. $10 billion.

Setting up of Foreign Investment Implementation Authority

To bridge the gap between FDI approvals and actual inflows, a Foreign Investment Implementation Authority (FIAA) has been set up as an institutional response to provide foreign investors with a single point interface with various approval authorities at both the central and state levels.

(Continued from page 6)

Government from March 24, 1977 to July 28, 1979.

Widely respected within the country and abroad as a statesman of the genre of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, Shri Vajpayee’s 1998-99 stint as Prime Minister has been characterised as ‘one year of courage of conviction’. It was during this period that India entered a select group of nations following a series of successful nuclear tests at Pokharan in May 1998. The bus journey to Pakistan in February 1999 was widely acclaimed for starting a new era of negotiations to resolve the outstanding problems of the subcontinent. India’s honesty made an impact on the world community. Later, when this gesture of friendship turned out to be a betrayal of faith in Kargil, Shri Vajpayee was also hailed for his successful handling of the situation in repulsing back the intruders from the Indian soil. It was during Shri Vajpayee’s 1998-99 tenure that despite a global recession, India achieved 5.8 per cent GDP growth, which was higher than the previous year. Higher agricultural production and increase in foreign exchange reserves during this period were indicative of a forward-looking economy responding to the needs of the people. “We must grow faster. We simply have no other alternative” has been Shri Vajpayee’s slogan focussing particularly on economic empowerment of the rural poor. The bold decisions taken by his Government for strengthening rural economy, building a strong infrastructure and revitalising the human development programmes, fully demonstrated his Government’s commitment to a strong and self-reliant nation to meet the challenges of the next millennium to make India an economic power in the 21st century. Speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of 52nd Independence Day, he had said, “I have a vision of India: an India free of hunger and fear, an India free of illiteracy and want.”

Shri Vajpayee has served on a number of important Committees of Parliament. He was Chairman, Committee on Government Assurances (1966-67); Chairman, Public Accounts Committee (1967-70); Member, General Purpose Committee (1986); Member, House Committee and Member, Business Advisory Committee, Rajya Sabha (1988-90); Chairman, Committee on Petitions, Rajya Sabha (1990-91); Chairman, Public Accounts Committee, Lok Sabha (1991-93); Chairman, Standing Committee on External Affairs (1993-96).

Prospects for further India-U.S. economic cooperation:

There are several areas where economic cooperation between India and the U.S. can progress further. These include IT, telecom, energy and other knowledge industries such as pharmaceuticals and bio-technology.

The IT sector is India's fastest growing sector with over 50% average annual growth since 1991. The turn over of the sector has increased from $2 billion in 1994-95 to $8.7 billion in 1999-2000. Today, nearly two in five of the Fortune 500 companies outsource their software requirements to India. As a consequence, there has been remarkable growth in India's software exports too, from $485 million in 1994-95 to $4 billion today. The share of North America (U.S. & Canada) in India's software exports is about 62%. During 1999-2000, U.S. investment in the computer industry in India accounted for over 50% of the total FDI inflow received by this sector.

Abundant investment opportunities exist for further strengthening India-U.S. economic ties in IT, especially, in areas like communication infrastructure, optic fiber cable, gateways, satellite-based communication wireless, IT-enabled services, IT enabled education, data centers and server farms, and software development.

Pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and chemical industries also provide great opportunities for closer cooperation. The Finance Minister of India, Mr. Yashwant Sinha stated during his recent visit to USA that one of the most important areas where there is a tremendous synergy between Indian and American enterprises are knowledge based projects and services where both the countries have competitive advantage as exporters. This is substantiated by the fact that India is one of the largest manufacturers and exporters of pharmaceuticals. It has a rich genetic pool and a large family structure ideal for studying diseases. It also holds the key for Genotype Drug Design and is widely acclaimed for its large pool of trained doctors and cost effective research & development (R&D) activities."
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000085.jpg,"Statement By External Affairs Minister In Parliament On The Situation In Sri Lanka May 4, 2000

Recent developments in northern Sri Lanka are a matter of serious concern to India. The Government is closely monitoring the evolving situation. The Government of Sri Lanka has also been in touch with the Government of India. Our High Commissioner to Sri Lanka was, therefore, called to New Delhi earlier this week for consultations on the developing situation.

The Government of India will be guided by its continued commitment, to a negotiated peaceful resolution of the conflict, within the framework of Sri Lanka's unity and territorial integrity; a united Sri Lanka where all communities can realize their aspirations. It is India's hope that peace will soon return to Sri Lanka, a country which is a close and friendly neighbour.

The Government of India has received some requests from the Government of Sri Lanka in the context of the present situation. Naturally, all these requests are receiving the urgent consideration of the Government.

The conflict in Northern Sri Lanka continues to cause serious hardship to civilians in the area. As Hon'ble Members are aware, there are nearly 100,000 Sri Lankan refugees in India, including about 30,000 outside the refugee camps, on humanitarian grounds, India continues to look after these refugees. In consequence with this, India will work to mitigate the hardship inflicted upon civilians by the conflict and will render such humanitarian assistance as may become necessary. As and when need arises such assistance will be decided upon only in consultation with Sri Lanka.

Ambassador Naresh Chandra's message on National Technology Day Washington, DC May 11, 2000

Today is India's National Technology Day, an occasion to recall the achievements of India in the field of science and technology and to acknowledge the partnership that has existed between the scientific communities of India and the United States.

The last five decades have witnessed tremendous strides in all fields of science and technology development in India. The introduction of high-yielding varieties, fertilizers, chemicals and mechanization in agriculture led to the green revolution, which transformed India from a food deficit country to a food exporting nation. Our vast network of biotechnology institutions are focusing attention on the frontiers of modern science. Our comprehensive range of skills and expertise on the cutting edge of science makes us one of seven nations worldwide with satellite launch capabilities. Our installed electricity generation capacity has increased from 1300 MW in 1947 to over 90000 MW today. India has one of the world's largest programs of renewable energy with a capacity of more than 1300 MW from renewable sources. Our health and nutrition standards have improved dramatically. Our remarkable success in IT industry has received global recognition.

During President Clinton's recent visit, India and the US signed a Science and Technology Forum Agreement with the intent to facilitate and promote Indo-US interaction between government, academia, and industry in science and technology. The Forum will promote research and development, the transfer of technology, the creation of a comprehensive electronic reference source for Indo-US science and technology cooperation, and the electronic exchange and dissemination of information on Indo-US science and technology cooperation. The Forum will commission studies, reports and papers and would assist in facilitating and promoting joint collaboration of projects.

I invite U.S. scientists, with many Indian Americans among them, to intensify their interaction with their Indian counterparts in pursuit of excellence for the greater good of humanity."

ion policy is being formulated and will be brought to the Cabinet soon,"" federal Civil Aviation Minister Sharad Yadav has said.

However, the minister refused to give details of the new policy saying that it was a ""sensitive"" issue. He said the government would set up more international airports, especially in the northern part of the country.

On the Y2K preparedness of the civil aviation sector in the country, the minister said the sector has already achieved 95 per cent Y2K compliance. ""We have solved the problem to a great extent. Our engineers are working on it and I'm quite sure that we will be fully prepared to meet it before the deadline,"" he said.

Government to reduce stake in banks below 51%

Indian Government will soon amend the banking laws to allow privatization of public sector banks to reduce its equity below 51 per cent. It would also put in place a policy on voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) in nationalized banks.

""The Nationalized Banks Act and Banking Regulation Act will be amended soon to bring down the government stake in public sector banks below 51 per cent,"" Devi Dayal, banking secretary in the finance ministry has said.

The amendments are likely to come in the next session of Parliament, he said. Dayal said by bringing down the stake below 51 per cent, government role in banks would be reduced in the future. He said the government was also formulating a policy of Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to bring down the staff costs in public sector banks.

Currently, other PSU companies have a policy on VRS and the policy currently being framed would be along similar lines, he said. ""The cost of staff in public sector banks is very high. By having a comprehensive policy on VRS, the costs can be brought down significantly,"" Dayal said, adding that this could help the banks to lend money at a lower rate of interest in future.

You appear to be emphasising survivability but will this not affect retaliation?

No. Retaliation does not have to be instantaneous; it has to be effective and assured. I emphasise this because effective and assured retaliation enhance the credibility of deterrence. Mobility and dispersal improve survivability. Operating procedures will ensure the transition from peace-time deployment modes to a higher state of readiness when required. Our nuclear assets are limited and consistent with no-first-use; we have ensured that these procedures do not tempt an adversary to preemption but strengthen deterrence by underlining the political resolve for effective retaliation.

Would it be correct to deduce that India will follow different peace-time and war-time deployment/postures?

This would be a correct assessment. You know that we would like to convey a sense of assurance in our region, also beyond so that our deployment posture is not perceived as de-stabilising. We have rejected notions of ""launch on warning postures"" that lead to maintaining hair trigger alerts, thus increasing the risks of an unauthorised launch. In fact, we have taken an initiative in the U.N. General Assembly last year, calling on all nuclear weapon States to review such postures, and move to de-alert, thus reducing global nuclear danger.

How does this posture relate to tactical nuclear weapons?

Regarding tactical nuclear weapons, let me remind you that we do not see nuclear weapons as weapons of war fighting. In fact, India sees them only as strategic weapons, whose role is to deter their use by an adversary. Civilian command and control over decisions relating to deployment and alert levels are logical.

Is there any change in India's position on elimination of nuclear weapons or, let me say, in India's approach towards this objective?

I would like to emphasise that there is no dilution of India's commitment to the objective of achieving a nuclear weapon-free world. We continue to call for negotiations for a Nuclear Weapons Convention that would prohibit the production, development, deployment and use of all nuclear weapons and also provide for elimination of present stockpiles under international verification. India is the only nuclear weapon State to do so. At the same time, we also understand that nuclear disarmament cannot be achieved overnight; it will be a step-by-step process. We approach this process in a practical sense from two directions. On one side, we need to strengthen the norm against nuclear weapons by multaterally negotiated non-use and no-first-use agreements. From a technical standpoint, we need to move away from the present hair-trigger postures to a progressively de-alerted state that will reduce the risks of accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons. It will also act as a global CBM. In both these areas, India continues to take initiatives and our resolutions in the U.N. General Assembly have been adopted with widespread support."

us that our nation has once again demonstrated its unshakable commitment to democracy.

Our nation continues to march on the path she adopted when she became a republic in 1950. With the successful completion of the last election of this century, India stands taller in the eyes of all democracy-loving people of the world.

It has been a long campaign. A lot of heat and dust were generated during this general election.

But now that the election is over, we should put the acrimony and bitterness of the last couple of months behind us. And get down to the task of nation-building. There is not a moment to lose.

The Opposition’s role in a democracy is no less important than that of the Government. It is a role mandated by the people and comes with a lot of responsibility.

Constructive criticism is an essential input for good policies and programmes. Consensus on national issues is necessary for effective action.

I look forward to both constructive criticism and consensus on national issues.

My countrymen, the world rushes ahead — whether or not we look up from our narrow concerns.

Neither do the tasks that confront us abate. The number of young women and men jobs must be provided continues to increase. Children still go to bed hungry. A sense of insecurity prevails.

The soul of India rebels against this reality.

Starting today, our Government has set itself the task of implementing our Agenda for a Proud, Prosperous India. It is my solemn pledge to all of you that nothing shall prevent us from the task of good governance.

We talk of the 21st century. In just ten weeks from today, India along with the rest of the world, will enter a new era of challenges and opportunities.

We are pledged to the emergence of a ‘new’ India in the new century.

We can redeem this pledge through collective effort, by resolutely meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities of the 21st century. We may have been sent to Parliament under the banners of different parties. But we have all been sent for a common task: to make India a strong, vigorous, prosperous and caring country.

To meet the challenges, we have to act now. In the coming days, our Government proposes to:

Speed up economic reforms and focus attention on infrastructure development. The new century demands a new mindset.

Introduce new laws for financial sector reforms so that India can keep pace with the rest of the world.

Evolve a programme for achieving fiscal rectitude by improved expenditure management, deep tax reforms and a new mechanism for speedier restructuring and disinvestment of Public Sector Units.

Promote investment, Including foreign direct investment, by adoption of suitable measures and removing bottlenecks that lead to costly delays.

Re-arrange priorities of development by re-deploying resources and strengthening institutions for providing to all:

Safe drinking water

Primary health services

Primary education

Rural roads

Housing to rural homeless

In this task, we seek the participation of the private sector.

My countrymen, all these tasks can be completed if we work together.

Let us proceed, as the Gita counsels us, Bodhyanta parasparam—imparting wisdom to each other.

The opportunities are unlimited. We can use each one of them to our national advantage if we stand united-both in prosperity and in the face of adversity. India’s greatest asset is her unity, and my Government is determined to maintain this unity at all cost.

Mr. President Pro tem,
Honourable Members of the United States Congress,
It is with a deep sense of honour that I speak to you today. I would like to thank you, Mr. Speaker, and the members of the Congress for giving me this opportunity.
In November 1999 a remarkable event took place in the House of Representatives. By a vote of 396 tot 4,the House adopted a resolution congratulating India and my government on the successful elections completed in October 1999. This display of broad-based bipartisan support for strengthening relations with India is heartening. It is a source of encouragement to both President Clinton and to me, as we work together to infuse a new quality in our times. I thank you for the near-unique approach that you have adopted towards my country. Those of you who saw the warm response to President Clinton's speech to our Parliament in March this year will recognise that similar cross-party support exists in India as well for deeper engagement with the USA. I am also deeply touched by the resolution adopted in the House two days ago welcoming my visit and the prospect of closer Indo-U.S. understanding. Mr. Speaker, American people have shown that democracy and individual liberty provide the conditions in which knowledge progresses, science discovers, innovation occurs, enterprise thrives and, ultimately, people advance. To more than a million and half from my country, America is now home. In turn, their industry, enterprise and skills are contributing to the advancement of American society. I see in the outstanding success of the Indian community in America, a metaphor of the vast potential that exists in Indo-U.S. relations, and what we can achieve together. Just as American experience has been a lesson in what people can achieve in a democratic framework, India has been the laboratory of a democratic process rising to meet the strongest challenges that can be flung at it.

In addition, the strategic interests of India and the United States are converging for the first time since India's independence in 1947. Specifically, the two most daunting challenges facing Indian and American policymakers are the threat posed by the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as an economic and military competitor. These factors should foster a frank and open dialogue with India's political leaders, who are a very patriotic and confident group.

Unlike high-level discussions with Chinese leaders, these will be a forum where Clinton can air a wide range of contentious issues such as nuclear proliferation, labor standards or Kashmir, without having to contend with onerous preconditions, prickly rejoinders or attempts at intimidation and retaliation.

Waiting for Clinton - in Jaipur

First, the president should make clear that the U.S. does not wish to remake the world in its own image. Echoing themes in his State of the Union address, Clinton can say that the U.S. and India are not only the world's two largest democracies but also the world's two largest multicultural societies. In an era plagued with ethnic violence, both countries have shown the world how to live with difference. The president should also let his hosts know that Americans appreciate the heterogeneity of world cultures and admire the contribution India's ancient and vibrant civilization makes to that diversity.

Second, the incumbent National Democratic Alliance government, and current public opinion here appear ready to accept a new relationship with Washington. Clinton should say that he is seeking to establish a cooperative partnership with India. He should indicate that the U.S. has discarded the Cold War tendency to balance and equate Pakistan and India, and that the U.S. recognizes India's leadership role in South Asia.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee

A man of the masses, firm in his political convictions. India has an inspiring leader in Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

On October 13, 1999, he took charge as Prime Minister of India for the second consecutive term at the head of a new coalition government, the National Democratic Alliance. He was Prime Minister for a short period in 1996. He is the only Prime Minister since Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to have become Prime Minister of India through three successive mandates.

A veteran Parliamentarian whose career stretches over four decades, Shri Vajpayee has been elected to the Lok Sabha (House of the People) nine times and to the Rajya Sabha (House of the States) twice, a record by itself. As India's Foreign Minister, Chairperson of various important Standing Committees of Parliament and Leader of Opposition, he has been an active participant in the shaping of India's post-Independence domestic and foreign policy.

Shri Vajpayee's first brush with nationalist politics was in his student days when he joined the Quit India Movement of 1942, which hastened the end of British colonial rule. A student of political science and law, it was in college that he developed a keen interest in foreign affairs — an interest he has nourished over the years and put to skillful use while representing India at various multilateral and bilateral fora.

Shri Vajpayee had embarked upon a journalist's career, which was cut short in 1951 when he joined the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the forerunner of today's Bharatiya Janata Party, the leading component of the National Democratic Alliance. A critically acclaimed poet, he still takes time off from affairs of state to indulge in music and in a bit of gourmet cooking.

Born in the family of a humble school teacher on December 25, 1924, in the erstwhile princely State of Gwalior (now a part of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh), Shri Vajpayee's rise in public life is a tribute to both his political acumen and Indian democracy. Over the decades, he has emerged as a leader who commands respect for his liberal worldview and commitment to democratic ideals.

An ardent champion of women's empowerment and social equality, Vajpayee believes in a forward-looking, forward moving India, a strong and prosperous nation confident of its rightful place in the comity of nations. He stands for an India anchored in 5000 years of civilizational history, ever modernizing, ever renewing, and ever re-energizing itself to meet the challenges of the next 1000 years.

India's second highest civilian honor, the Padma Vibhushan, was conferred upon him in recognition of his selfless dedication to his first and only love, India, and his more than half-a-century of service to society and the nation. In 1994, he was named India's 'Best Parliamentarian.' The citation read: ""True to his name, Atalji is an eminent national leader, an erudite politician, a selfless social worker, forceful orator, poet and litterateur, journalist and indeed a multi-faceted personality...Atalji articulates the aspirations of the masses... his works ever echo total commitment to nationalism."

By Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Prime Minister of India

International Herald Tribune - September 21, 2000

M Y RECENT visit to the United States has consolidated relations between the world's two largest democracies. The joint initiatives and understandings that we reached represent a major step forward. India and the United States can be natural allies in the 21st century. Events and circumstances over the last two years have confirmed this.

We are both motivated by shared values that give freedom, dignity, democracy and tolerance the highest priority. Open societies oppose international terrorism which, in the cloak of religious extremism, is eating away at the foundation of democratic nations.

The integrity of nation-states as building blocks of a stable international order is threatened by newly-promoted concepts of interventionism that add to insecurity and social chaos. The principle of social equity that must underline economic prosperity and globalisation is often ignored. Barriers to mutually enriching science and technology must be removed to promote creativity and knowledge to the full.

As the two biggest open societies, India and the United States must address these pressing concerns. Agreement and common action would be ideal; but disagreement on some issues should not constitute division. We have agreed that, as our dialogue proceeds, we will listen with respect to each other and seek to accommodate our mutual concerns.

As natural allies, it is important that India and the United States remain engaged. Contacts should be so frequent that they become routine. President Bill Clinton's visit to India in March took place after a gap of 22 years. In the fast-changing world in which we live, even 22 months is an unacceptable interruption.

India is growing at an annual rate of more than 6 per cent; we aim to reach 9 per cent and beyond. Such growth results from unshackling the energy and enterprise of the Indian people. India is a vast market as well as an expanding platform for manufacture and services. Its growth has generated an insatiable thirst for green energy, efficient communications and modern infrastructure. India is open for business and partnership.

India is in the vanguard of the knowledge revolution. Information technology and knowledge-intensive industries, including biotechnology, entertainment, communications and services, have taken root. They are now moving beyond India to network at a global level. Traditional industry and science also continue to flourish. India today is equally adept in both ""brick"" and ""click"" economies.

No armies from India have stepped out to conquer and dominate others. We want a world free of weapons of mass destruction. But security in the real world must be based on the principle of equal security for all. Without a non-discriminatory world order, our experience has taught us that peace lies in strength. The security of one billion Indians is central to Asia's security and stability. Yet peace and strength are not incompatible. As a nuclear weapon state, our approach is guided by a sense of responsibility and transparency that we urge others to adopt.

A unilateral moratorium on explosive tests, a policy of ""no first use,"" a tight export control regime and a willingness to engage with other countries on all aspects of international security are the principles of India's nuclear policy."

The two leaders agreed that India and the United States must build upon this new momentum in their relationship to further enhance mutual understanding and deepen cooperation across the full spectrum of political, economic, commercial, scientific, technological, social, and international issues.

During this visit, the two leaders had productive discussions across a wide range of bilateral, regional, and international developments. In the economic arena, they agree that India's continuing economic reforms, as well as the two countries' complementary strengths and resources, provide strong bases for expansion of economic ties between the two countries. The two leaders recognized the need to deepen cooperation on high-tech trade issues. They noted that the present regime on e-commerce would be rolled over until the next ministerial meeting of the WTO, and that the two countries would cooperate in building a wider international consensus on information technology. The two leaders pledged their joint commitment to bridge the digital divide, both within and between countries, so that the benefits of information technology may advance the economic and social development of all citizens, rich and poor.

The two leaders expressed satisfaction with their agreement on textiles. They also affirmed the need for expansion of bilateral civil aviation ties and agreed to work toward this goal. They recognized the contribution that biotechnology can make to a safe and nutritious food supply, in offering new options to farmers to address problems of pests and diseases, while contributing to environmental protection and enhancing global food security. The governments of the United States and India will explore ways of enhancing cooperation and information exchange, joint collaborative projects and training of scientists in agriculture biotechnology research. The ongoing vaccine research would be further strengthened also, making use of genomics and bioinformatics. The governments of both the United States and India support science-based regulatory activities.

They also noted significant progress on other important economic issues including mutual taxation and investment in the power and other sectors. In regard to double taxation issues, the competent authorities of both sides intend to soon negotiate an arrangement under which collection or recovery of tax will generally be suspended on a reciprocal basis, during pendency of a mutual agreement proceeding. To ensure sustainable economic growth that will lift the lives of rich and poor alike, the two leaders committed support for efforts that will make capital markets more efficient, transparent, and accountable to attract the billions in private investment that is needed.

They recognize the need for appropriate technology for power generation, and the importance of greater South Asian regional cooperation and trade in energy, as well as the development and application of clean technologies that address our respective problems of urban and water pollution. The leaders noted with satisfaction the signings of several major commercial agreements, under which U.S. firms will contribute to the development of the power industry in India.

The United States and India intend to harness their cooperation in emerging scientific and economic sectors into a partnership for defining new ways of fighting hunger, disease, pollution, and other global challenges of our time. The two leaders pledged their strong commitment to address the global challenge of the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS through the close involvement and cooperation between the governments and civil society in the two countries. They expressed support for the collaborative program for research in various areas, including HIV/AIDS vaccine development, through the Joint Working Groups of scientists envisaged by the Joint Statement of June 2000. They agreed to encourage the formation of a business council to combat HIV/AIDS with the active involvement and participation of business and industry to raise awareness in the industrial workplace.

The two leaders discussed international security. They recalled the long history of Indo-U.S. cooperation in UN peacekeeping operations, most recently in Sierra Leone. The two leaders agreed to broaden their cooperation in peacekeeping and other areas of UN activity, including in shaping the future international security system. The two leaders also discussed the evolving security environment in Asia, recalling their common desire to work for stability in Asia and beyond. They agreed that the Asian Security Dialogue that the two countries have initiated will strengthen mutual understanding.

If they are lacking in these, the Constitution cannot help the country"". I believe these are wise words which we should pay heed to. The form of Government, the parliamentary democratic form, was chosen by the founding fathers after deep thought and debate. In the Constituent Assembly Dr. Ambedkar explained that the Drafting Committee in choosing the Parliamentary system for India, preferred more responsibility to more stability, a system under which the Government will be on the anvil every day. said accountability was still difficult to obtain from day-to-day. Thus the Parliamentary system was a deliberate and well thought out choice by the Constituent Assembly. It was not chosen in imitation of the British system or because of the familiarity with it that India had acquired during the colonial period. Gandhiji while acknowledging our debt to Britain with regard to parliamentary Government had observed that the roots of it were present in India in the age-old system of the village panchayats. Dr. Ambedkar explained in the Constituent Assembly that the Buddhist Sanghas were parliamentary type of institutions and that in their functioning modern parliamentary devices like resolutions, divisions, whips, etc. were used. These elements in our heritage made it possible and easy for India to adopt the parliamentary system of democracy. Besides, as Dr. Ambedkar told the Constituent Assembly the system was chosen because they preferred more responsibility to stability which could slip into authoritarian exercise of power. Another factor to be borne in mind is the immensity of India, the perplexing variety and diversity of the country, the very size of its population and the complexity of the social and developmental problems. In such a predicament described by one writer, as one of ""a million mutinies"" there must in the body-political a vent for discontent and frustrations to express themselves in order to forestall and prevent major explosions in society. The parliamentary system provides this vent more than a system which prefers stability to responsibility and accountability. Our recent experience of instability in Government is perhaps no sufficient reason to discard the parliamentary system in favour of the presidential or any other form. In my opinion we should avoid too much rigidity in our system of government as in a very rigid system there is the danger of major explosions in society taking place. The possibility and the facility of a change in government is itself a factor in the stability of the political system in the long-run because then the people will be more inclined to tolerate a political situation they do not approve of or find difficult to cope with for long. At any rate as Dr. Rajendra Prasad said the shortcomings in the people entrusted with running the system cannot be obviated by constitutional changes or provisions. Amendments to the Constitution are a different matter. The founding fathers deliberately made the amendment process of the Constitution easy so that shortcomings or lacunae in the Constitution can be rectified by the Parliament without too much difficulty. There are other changes that can be brought about like changes in the electoral law or the functioning of the political parties. Whatever we may do, and we have a right to bring about necessary changes in the political and economic system, we should ensure that the basic philosophy behind the Constitution and the fundamental socio-economic soul of the Constitution remain sacrosanct. We should not throw out the baby with the bath water and like the tragic character Othello in Shakespeare has to lament later ""Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away - Richer than all his tribe."""
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000025.jpg,"Draft Report of National Security Advisory Board on Indian Nuclear Doctrine August 17, 1999

Preamble

1.1. The use of nuclear weapons in particular as well as other weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical weapons which have been outlawed by international treaties, nuclear weapons remain instruments for national and collective security, the possession of which on a selective basis has been sought to be legitimised through permanent extension of the Nuclear. Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) in May 1995. Nuclear weapon states have asserted that they will continue to rely on nuclear weapons with some of them adopting policies to use them even in a non-nuclear context. These developments require an environment of durable peace and insurance against potential risks to peace and stability. It will be India's endeavour to proceed towards this overall objective in cooperation with the global democratic trends and to play a constructive role in advancing the international system toward a just, peaceful and equitable order.

1.2. India's primary objective is to achieve economic, political, social, scientific and technological development within a peaceful and democratic framework. This requires an environment of durable peace and insurance against potential risks to peace and stability. It will be India's endeavour to proceed towards this overall objective in cooperation with the global democratic trends and to play a constructive role in advancing the international system toward a just, peaceful and equitable order.

1.3. Autonomy of decision making in the developmental process and in strategic matters is an inalienable democratic right of the Indian people. India will strenuously guard this right in a world where nuclear weapons for a select few are sought to be legitimised for an indefinite future, and where there is growing complexity and frequency in the use of force for political purposes.

1.4. India's security is an integral component of its development process. India continuously aims at promoting an ever-expanding area of peace and stability around it so that developmental priorities can be pursued without disruption.

1.5. However, the very existence of offensive doctrine pertaining to the first use of nuclear weapons and the insistence of some nuclear weapons states on the legitimacy of their use even against non-nuclear weapon countries constitute a threat to peace, stability and

1.6. This document outlines the broad principles for the development, deployment and employment of India's nuclear forces. Details of policy and strategy concerning force structures, deployment and employment of nuclear forces will flow from this framework and will be laid down separately and kept under constant review.

2 INDIA NEWS • October 1, 1999

2.1. In the absence of global nuclear disarmament India's strategic interests require effective, credible nuclear deterrence and adequate retaliatory capability should deterrence fail. This is consistent with the UN Charter, which sanctions the right of self-defence.

2.2. The requirements of deterrence should be carefully weighed in the design of Indian nuclear forces and in the strategy to provide for a level of capability consistent with maximum credibility, survivability, effectiveness, safety and security.

2.3. India shall pursue a doctrine of credible minimum nuclear deterrence. In this policy of 'retaliation only', the survivability of our arsenal is critical. This is a dynamic concept related to the strategic environment, technological imperatives and the needs of national security. The actual size components, deployment and employment of nuclear forces will be decided in the light of these factors. India's peacetime posture aims at convincing any potential aggressor that:

(a) any threat of use of nuclear weapons against India shall invoke measures to counter the threat; and

(b) any nuclear attack on India and its forces shall result in punitive retaliation with nuclear weapons to inflict damage unacceptable to the aggressor.

2.4. The fundamental purpose of Indian nuclear weapons is to deter the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons by any State or entity against India and its forces. India will not be the first to initiate a nuclear strike, but will respond with punitive retaliation should deterrence fail.

2.5. India will not resort to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against States which do not possess nuclear weapons, or are not aligned with nuclear weapon powers.

2.6. Deterrence requires that India maintain:

(a) Sufficient, survivable and operationally prepared nuclear forces,

(b) a robust command and control system,

(c) effective intelligence and early warning capabilities,

(d) comprehensive planning and training for operations in line with the strategy,

(e) the will to employ nuclear forces and weapons

2.7. Highly effective conventional military capabilities shall be maintained to raise the threshold of outbreak both of conventional military conflict as well as that of threat or use of nuclear weapons."

On the morning of October 29, 1999, a cyclone struck the coast of Orissa, in northeastern India on the Bay of Bengal. Winds of between 155 and 161 miles an hour, heavy rains and waves between 13 and 20 feet high accompanied the storm. Orissa is home to 32 million people. This storm struck just 10 days after another cyclone hit Orissa on the evening of October 17. The first storm ripped across the Gopalpur coast, devastating the district of Ganjam, which was in the eye of the storm.

Prime Minister's Relief Fund

Government of India and Embassy of India continue to receive a number of offers for contributions to the cyclone relief activities in Orissa, India. Those who wish to make voluntary contributions may do so by sending checks in dollars orrupees to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund.

Facts on Orissa

Orissa is located in the northeast of India. Its northern plateau slopes down to fertile green coastal plains on the Bay of Bengal. To the northeast lies the state of West Bengal, and its capital, Calcutta. About one-third of Orissa is covered with forests.

Orissa state has a population of nearly 32 million people. Area of the State is just over 62,000 square miles.

The capital, Bhubaneshwar, is known as the ""Temple City of India.""

Orissa's economy is largely based on agriculture, which provides 80 percent of rural employment and more than half of the state's income. One-tenth of India's rice production comes from Orissa. Other major crops include pulses, oil seeds, jute, sugarcane, turmeric and coconut.

Orissa lies in the tropics. The average rainfall is about 59 inches a year. The temperature ranges from a high of 120 degrees in the summer to a low of 41 degrees in the winter.

/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000115.jpg,"Dedication of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial

(Prime Minister Vajpayee dedicated the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial in the distinguished presence of President Clinton on September 16, 2000. The memorial, established by an Act of the U.S. Congress, is located on federal land opposite to the Embassy of India.)

Prime Minister's address after dedication:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am delighted to be with all of you this morning.

Today is, indeed, a memorable day for all of us. I have arrived here after unveiling a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in front of the Indian Embassy.

I am grateful to President Clinton for taking time out of his schedule to join me at the function. This extraordinary gesture, along with the glowing tributes he paid to the Mahatma in his opening remarks at the White House ceremony yesterday, have further endeared America and its President to our people.

With the unveiling of Gandhiji’s statue in Washington, one of the greatest apostles of peace has, in a sense, arrived physically in the capital of the world’s eldest democracy.

But the Mahatma’s spirit has been with the people of America for the greater part of the last century.

Indeed, he was with Americans, not too far from here, 37 years ago. On that occasion, a quarter million Americans marched to Lincoln Memorial to hear Martin Luther King outline his dream of a truly emancipated America.

King’s guiding light was Mahatma Gandhi. As he said: “The Christian doctrine of love, operating through the Gandhian method of non-violence, was for me the most potent weapon available to the oppressed people in their struggle for freedom.”

Gandhiji’s unique method of passive resistance proved to be an enormously active force against colonial oppression. His use of non-cooperation, civil disobedience and non-violence as instruments in the struggle for freedom touched the American people as much as it did people all over the world. America’s own struggle for independence had an important influence on India’s freedom movement. Gandhiji has acknowledged that the great American philosopher Thoreau was his teacher in “the science of civil disobedience.”

Gandhiji’s personality had a magnetic effect on many people in this country. All of us know about the incomparable homage paid to him by Albert Einstein.

But not so well known is the effect he had on ordinary Americans. For example, Samuel Evans Stokes, a wealthy American from Philadelphia, gave up everything to become a soldier in the Mahatma’s army of Satyagrahis in India.

He even changed his name to ‘Satyanand’ Stokes and had the rare honour of being the only American to become a member of the All India Congress Committee."
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000012.jpg,"On the 26th of November this year it will be 50 years since we adopted, enacted and gave to ourselves the Constitution of India. The Constitution is the sheet anchor of our polity. It is my earnest hope that it would continue to be respected by all, and be an instrument of social change and transformation of the status of the underprivileged as envisaged by Babasaheb Ambedkar.

Science and technology, which occupy the centre stage in our progress is paying heed to the human dimensions of development. Thanks to the efforts put in during the first two or three decades India can today boast of a stabilized green revolution, a diversified industrial infrastructure, and a Science and Technology base for our further development. While Jawaharlal Nehru's vision of ""science solving the problem of hunger and poverty"" in our country has not yet been fulfilled, we have been able to break the back of the demon of hunger by resort to science in our agriculture. Our progress in the development of satellites, atomic energy, information technology and bio-technology are not merely climbing the high peaks of Science and Technology, but are applying the techniques to grass-root problems and to the human needs of the country. It is heartening that our scientists are now wide awake to the importance of patenting our diverse genetic riches before they are taken away by the advanced nations. India is bound to emerge as a major scientific-technological power in the new millennium.

Rolling back or putting a cap on the advancement of science is contrary to the very spirit and nature of science, and against the equitable world order that we are pledged to bring into being.

Friends, in a few weeks from now the people of India will be exercising their franchise to elect the 13th Lok Sabha and some of the State Assemblies. Our record of orderly elections, which form the basis of our democratic polity, is now acknowledged by the world. Indian voters have exercised their franchise and chosen their representatives with practical common sense; they have reposed confidence with generosity; withdrawn it without ambiguity; created, preserved and demolished mandates. No one dares take the Indian voter for granted. It is gratifying for us that today the world significance of Indian democracy has begun to dawn upon the developed democracies of the world. But still we must not forget that often in global power-politics the blood of strategic affinity is thicker than the life-giving waters of democracy.

I would like to avail this opportunity to urge all contestants and campaigners in the coming polls to maintain our democracy's track record, to abjure appeals of a narrow sectarian nature and show a broad tolerance of opinions of others. I trust that the ugly phenomenon of voter-intimidation and booth-capturing which has marred voting in some pockets in the past, will not be tolerated anywhere on this occasion. The firmness shown in this regard by our Election Commission has been widely appreciated.

Our Election Commission, our Judiciary and other Constitutional authorities like the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, are institutions of which we are proud for their impartiality, objectivity and sense of responsibility.

Likewise we derive great satisfaction from the functioning of the National Commissions that have been set up for the welfare of our minorities, women, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and other vulnerable sections of our society.

Fellow citizens and friends, on this last Independence Day of the century we have every reason to look forward to the new millennium with hope and self-assurance. Despite all the obstacles set in our path we are well served by the strength of our democratic institutions and we draw sustenance from our rich heritage from the past and from the reawakened spirit of our people. In this spirit we send our greetings to our neighbours in South Asia - to Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Pakistan with whom we are engaged in the adventure of building up SAARC as a prosperous and viable regional entity. We also send our greetings to the friendly countries of ASEAN with whom we are closely associated, to Japan and to the countries of West Asia and Central Asia with whom we have traditional ties of friendship. I am delighted that our relations with the People's Republic of China have improved. On the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, I would like to send our warm greetings to the people and government of China. It is a matter of satisfaction to us that our relations with the countries of the sister continent of Africa, the Commonwealth of Nations, the European Union and the United States of America are marked by warmth and understanding. Our close relations with our time-tested friend, Russia, continue to develop and diversify in several fields as well as in multilateral fora; this is most gratifying.

From the inception of our Independence India has been striving for a one-world that is free from the scourge of war and free of weapons of mass destruction. In the new century that is at our doorstep we pledge ourselves to persist with this effort. Towards this we would like to see the full potential and scope of the United Nations Organization realized through wider representation and restructuring. We will continue to attach the greatest importance to the Non-Aligned Movement in the formation of which we take pride and which has played an important role in ending the nightmare of the Cold War and which we believe is of relevance in providing stability and balance to the pluralistic world order that is emerging.

Friends, on this Independence Day let us resolve to imbue our lives with the spirit of that midnight hour when we made our tryst with destiny. May the tricolor continue to inspire us and fulfil our destiny as a people and as a nation."

Government has announced the much-awaited liberalization of satellite up linking policy allowing all TV channels to uplink from India, irrespective of their equity holding. Information: and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley said the new policy would bring a large Number of TV channels within the country's broadcasting codes. He said as per the new policy an Indian company, which needs not be a broadcaster, would be permitted to set up linking hub for renting out to broadcasters. Permissible foreign equity in such companies would be limited to 49 per cent, including NRI and Overseas corporate bodies' (OCB) investments, as in the case of telecom sector. The hubs would be permitted to uplink only those TV channels which are permitted by the government, he said, adding companies could uplink through both Indian and foreign satellites, although preference would be given to the former. He said the new policy would also allow up linking facility to Indian news agencies, which are wholly owned by Indians, for news gathering and distribution. Jaitley said this would give the Indian news agencies the much-desired competitive edge over the foreign news agencies.

Joint Ventures mooted in Nuclear Power

Joint ventures in nuclear power sector should be possible within next five years once the required changes are made in the Atomic mission,"" Shyamal Ghosh, Secretary of Department of Telecom (DoT), said. Ghosh said that with the foreign equity limit in e-commerce sector pegged at 100 per cent there was a strong case for increasing the FDI in ISP sector. However, declined to comment on the quantum of FDI increase being considered by the commission. On the National Long Distance (NLD) norms, Ghosh said that various issues including intra circle traffic and the revenue sharing were being considered. FDI up to 100 per cent would be allowed in e-commerce subject to the condition that the company would divest 26 per cent to the public within five years if it were already listed abroad.

Economy will grow by over seven per cent this year: Sinha

Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha has exuded confidence that the economy would grow over eleven per cent and government would achieve the Rs 100 billion disinvestment target in the current financial year. ""I see no reason to deviate from by projection of seven per cent plus growth in the current fiscal,"" Sinha said. Similarly, there is no reason why the government should not achieve the disinvestment target for the year, he added. Asked about interest rates, he said it would not be surprising if banks raised rates as the stock markets have already factored in such a development following the decision of Reserve Bank of India to hike bank rate and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)."

President K.R. Narayanan's address on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Republic of India Central Hall of Parliament, January 27, 2000

It gives me great pleasure to be here amidst you at this solemn function to mark the Golden Jubilee Celebrations of the birth of the Indian Republic and the commencement of our Constitution. The establishment of the democratic Republic of India was obviously, a significant and glorious event for India, for the freedom and welfare of the hundreds and millions of its people. But it was also a world event of far-reaching significance. People talk about the triumph of democracy in a significant and glorious event for India, for the freedom and welfare of the hundreds and millions of its people. For that triumphant outcome, democracy in India has had a meaningful part to play not in the way of taking part in the ideological cold war, but in the sense of setting an over powering example to the world.

What Sir Anthony Eden, the Prime Minister of Britain, said at the time of the emergence of the Indian Republic is relevant in this context. ""Of all the experiments in government, which have been attempted since the beginning of time, I believe that the Indian venture into parliametary government is the most exciting. A vast continent is attempting to apply to its tens and thousands of millions a system of free democracy... It is a brave thing to try to do so. The Indian venture is not a pale imitation of our practice at home, but a magnified and multiplied reproduction on a scale we have never dreamt of. If it succeeds, its influence on Asia is incalculable for good. Whatever the outcome we must honour those who attempt it.""

Even more meaningful was the opinion expressed by an American Constitutional authority, Prof. Granville Austin who wrote that, what the Indian Constituent Assembly began was ""perhaps the greatest political venture since that originated in Philadelphia in 1787.""

Mahatma Gandhi had visualized the new Constitution of India in terms of universal values applied to the specific and special conditions of India. As early as 1931 he had written ""I shall strive for a Constitution which will release India from thraldom and patronage. I shall work for an India in which the poorest shall feel that it is their country in whose making they have an effective voice: an India in which there is no high class or low class of people, an India in which all communities shall live in perfect harmony. There can be no room in such an India for the curse of untouchability. We shall be at peace with the rest of the world neither exploiting nor exploited. All interests not in conflict with the interests of the dumb millions will be scrupulously respected whether foreign or indigenous. Personally, I hate the distinction between foreign and indigenous. This is the India of my dreams for which I shall struggle.""

At the core of the Constitution lies the essence of this Gandhian dream in the form of social justice and social democracy. Prof. Granville Austin has described the Indian Constitution as ""first and foremost a social document"". He further explained that ""the majority of India's constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement"". The very same point was elaborated in eloquent terms by Dr. Ambedkar and Pandit Nehru. What makes our Constitution relevant to the conditions and the problems of India and the developing world as a whole, is, in fact, the socio-economic soul of its uniqueness is that it has combined this harmoniously with the liberal rights and freedoms as conceived by the Western democracies.

It is after deep thought and considerable debate that the founding fathers adopted the philosophy and the form of Government for India. Speaking on the draft of the Constitution Dr. Ambedkar claimed that ""It is workable, it is flexible and it is strong enough to hold the country together both in peace time and in war time. Indeed, if I may say so, if things go wrong under the new Constitution, the reason will not be that we had a bad Constitution. What we will have to say is that Man is vile"". Today when there is so much talk about revising the Constitution or even writing a new Constitution, we have to consider whether it is the Constitution that has failed us or whether it is we who have failed the Constitution. Dr. Rajendra Prasad, as President of the Constituent Assembly, had pointed out: ""If the people who are elected are"

Third Ministerial Conference of WTO in Seattle

November 30 - December 03, 1999

The Union Minister of Commerce & Industry, Mr. Murasoli Maran, led the Indian delegation to the Third Ministerial Conference of the WTO. The delegation also included Members of Parliament, senior officials from different Ministries and representatives from the apex chambers of commerce and industry.

Even before the commencement of the Conference there were widespread protests and demonstrations in Seattle by a number of anti-WTO groups ranging from environmental activists to labour unions. The inaugural session, which was to be held in the forenoon of November 30, 1999, had to be abandoned because of disturbances.

The Chairmen of various Working Groups tried to narrow down the differences in their respective groups with a view to arriving at a consensus in the draft Ministerial text that had been transmitted from the Geneva preparatory process. However, in view of the wide divergence of views, no group could present draft texts for inclusion in the Ministerial declaration acceptable to all the members. The Chairperson observed that divergences of opinion remained that would take time to be narrowed down. It was therefore, decided to suspend the work of the Seattle Ministerial Conference.

Post Seattle scenario:

India is taking advantage of this 'time out' to consolidate its position on issues of its interest in the WTO. Three pronged efforts have been launched which are as follows:

(a) On the one hand, India has continued to highlight the areas of its concern at important bilateral and multilateral meetings, which have been as follows:

In his meeting with the Director General WTO on January 12, 2000 at New Delhi, Minister for Commerce and Industry emphasised that globalisation has caused uneven growth, increasing the disparities between the richest and the poorest. This has to be addressed, inter alia, by addressing the implementation problems in existing Agreements and operationalising the special and differential clauses in favour of developing countries. A consensus could be reached only if the more controversial issues, such as non-trade related issues, could be eliminated from WTO.

In his statement at UNCTAD-X (Bangkok - February 13, 2000), the Minister highlighted that ""International rule making must ...permit flexibility and autonomy to developing countries to pursue their material development strategies on the basis of needs and aspirations of their people."" He registered a strong protest on the part of the developing countries as to how issues extraterous to trade, such as labour standards, are sought to be put on the negotiating agenda, while, on the other hand issues such as the cross border movement of persons, a matter of great interest to developing countries is resisted by developed countries. On the margins of the UNCTAD Conference at Bangkok, he had also used this opportunity to have bilateral and plurilateral meetings with a view to evolve common stand on important WTO issues.

The UNCTAD Plan of Action has taken on board some of the important concerns of developing countries on implementation issues by inter alia recognising that ""in the course of implementation of the WTO Agreements, most developing countries consider that certain imbalances and asymmetries exist"" and that ""these problems need to be addressed ur-"

The joint Business Council has become more active in recent years and has organized several promotional events, apart from their annual meeting held alternately in New Delhi and in Washington.

U.S. Investments in India
India's gradual and steady integration with the global economy has led to a quantum jump in Indo-US economic ties. USA continues to be the dominant investor in India in terms of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) approvals, actual inflows and portfolio investment.

Total FDI inflows between 1991 and April 1999 were $12.6 billion. US FDI inflows were about $2.3 billion between 1991 and April 1999. Like in FDI Approvals, US lead the FDI Inflows as well.

The US investments in India accounted for 25% of all foreign direct investment (FDI) approved from 1991 - September 1999.

Foreign Direct Investment Approvals: 1991 - September 1999

* Until September, 1999

The overall inflow-approval ratio is nearly 23%. This ratio is underestimated due to varying gestation periods of approved projects, with greater delay in inflows from mega projects (which account for almost half of the FDI approvals). Excluding mega projects, the inflow-approval ratio works out much larger at 50%.

Major industries attracting US investment are fuel (Power & Oil Refinery) and telecommunications. The other major industries include chemicals, metallurgical industries and service industries. Most of the leading Fortune 500 US companies have already started their operations in India.

Outlook
The improved performance of the Indian economy during 1999, continued emphasis on economic reforms and liberalization and India's technology sectors are the positive reasons for increased interest in India as a destination for US investments and exports. Going by the current trends, the year 2000 should reach record levels of US FDI and FII inflows into India."

ECONOMIC reforms introduced in 1991 have radically changed the course of the Indian economy and led to its gradual integration with the global economy. Benefits of the reform process are visible in the form of better growth rates, higher investment and trade flows.

The effect of these reforms on trade and investment relations with the United States has been profound. It is now not only the largest investor country in India, it is also India's largest trading partner.

Indian economy today - a brief overview

India is among the fastest growing economies of the world today, with a growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 7% during the last 10 years. During 1999-2000 (April-March), GDP registered a 6.4% growth. Industrial production increased by 8%. The performance of infrastructure sector improved significantly. Inflation rate was a nominal 2-3% for the first time in decades. Exports, in terms of U.S. dollars, increased by 11.6%. India also continued to maintain a healthy balance of payments with foreign exchange reserves increasing by $6.1 billion during the year to over $35 billion. All indications are that the economy will continue to maintain its strong showing during the current fiscal year with exports recording a growth of over 28% and industrial production of 5.6% during the first quarter (April-June 2000).

U.S. Investments in India

U.S. accounts for 22% of all foreign direct investment (FDI) approved in India (This excludes Euro issues and NRI investments). Between 1991 and June 2000, out of the $63.1 billion foreign direct investments approved, the US constituted $14.2 billion.

Country-wise FDI Approval (US $ million)

USA 22%
Germany 4%
Japan 4%
UK 7%
South Korea 4%
Mauritius 10%
France 10%
Italy 10%
Canada 10%
Australia 10%
India 10%

U.S. is also the largest investor in terms of actual FDI inflow into India. U.S. FDI inflow was about $2.5 billion between 1991 and June 2000 against a total FDI inflow into the country of $21.3 billion. The overall U.S. FDI inflow-approval ratio is 18%. But during the last three years, the ratio has improved to 27%. This has registered a further significant improvement during the first six months of 2000 and reached 33%.

Upgrading India

The Clinton administration has finally publicly recognized a process that has been going on for some time in South Asia: a revolutionary change in the balance of power - the emergence of India as a nuclear power and the strategic decline of Pakistan. The president's trip was historic in the sense that it recognized the end of the Cold War in South Asia and with it the end of the special U.S.-Pakistani relationship that was directly connected to the Cold War.

— Amos Perlmutter — Washington Times — March 28, 2000

Clinton Lauds Technology as Key to India's Economy

HYDERABAD, India, March 24 — President Clinton saluted India's information-technology industry today, the core of the country's steady economic growth and a supplier of brain power to Silicon Valley in California.

This was the last full day of Mr. Clinton's visit to India, and after having dealt with tricky strategic and political questions, it seemed appropriate that the president should concentrate on the economy, the area where there is probably the most commonality between the United States and India.

The number of Internet users in India is expected to grow 10 times in the next four years, he added. The worth of India's information-technology exports have catapulted, to $4 billion from $150 million 10 years ago. The Indian government projects that by 2008 the exports will grow to $85 billion.

— By Jane Perlez — New York Times — March 25, 2000

Clinton Helps Boost U.S.-India Trade Ties

India's huge, emerging middle class—estimated at 200 million or more people—represents a vast opportunity for U.S. business. Clinton also announced that the U.S. Export-Import Bank will provide more than $2 billion in financing to small- and medium-sized enterprises in India. Included is $358 million in financing to India's Jet Airways to buy 10 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, to be delivered next year.

The agreements culminated what Commerce Secretary William M. Daley called ""a highly successful"" trip to this nation of 1 billion people. Earlier in the day, Clinton visited Hyderabad, a center of India's thriving high-tech industry, to tout the economic potential of the information age.

— By Edwin Chen — Los Angeles Times — March 25, 2000

A Passage to a New Era of Peace, Prosperity

Clinton's visit can defuse tensions if he shows a new acceptance of New Delhi's world prominence.

Engaging with India holds many benefits for the United States. It will create a context of trust for dealing with India on sensitive regional and global security issues such as nonproliferation and terrorism. India will be a major factor for stability in Asia in this century. The U.S. needs the regular, high-level dialogue with Indian leaders that closer ties will bring.

India's economy, poised for takeoff if reforms proceed, offers important opportunities to American companies and investors. They can profit not only by selling to India but also by tapping its supply of low-cost, skilled labor. In the dynamic, knowledge-based industries such as information technology and biotechnology, India and the U.S. have complementary advantages in an open world trading system. And India will be pivotal to progress on the pressing social issues—public health, human rights, poverty alleviation and the environment—central to American foreign policy in coming years.

/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000136.jpg,"India-U.S. Relations: Trade

THE United States is India's largest trading partner and export destination. Two way trade in 1999 totaled U.S. $12.79 billion reflecting an increase of more than 100% since 1992. India-U.S. trade over the last 8 years has been as under:

India's Exports | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
India's Exports | 3,781 | 4,551 | 5,302 | 5,736 | 6,169 | 7,321 | 8,225 | 9,083
India's Imports | 1,914 | 2,761 | 2,296 | 3,596 | 3,318 | 3,616 | 3,545 | 3,707
Turnover | 5,695 | 7,312 | 7,598 | 9,032 | 9,487 | 10,937 | 11,770 | 12,790
Balance (+) | 1,866 | 1,790 | 3,005 | 2,440 | 2,851 | 3,705 | 4,680 | 5,376

During January-May 2000, India's exports to the U.S. totaled $4.53 billion, while its imports from U.S. amounted to $1.53 billion during the same period, resulting in a positive trade balance of $3 billion.

Growth Rate

India's exports to the U.S. increased by 10.44% in 1999, compared to 12.34% in 1998. Imports from the U.S. grew by 4.59% during 1999 compared to a decline of 1.96% in 1998. During January-May 2000, our exports to the U.S. increased by 27% as compared to the same period last year. Our imports from the U.S. grew by only 3%.

India's share in U.S. trade

The volume of India-U.S. bilateral trade remains a small fraction of U.S.'s global trade. While U.S. exports to India account for nearly 12% of India's non-oil imports and U.S. is the destination of 18.9% of India's exports, U.S.'s trade turnover with India constitutes less than 1% of its global trade. Our share in U.S. imports has remained more or less stable over the last 3 years; it was 0.89% during 1999. India ranks 23rd among countries that export to the U.S.

India - U.S. trade composition

The composition of India's exports has undergone a change over the years. Our exports to the U.S. have been rising mainly on account of significant increases in the exports of gems & jewelry, textiles and ready-made garments, machinery, carpets, footwear and leather products, dyes, iron and steel products, chemicals, edible fruit and nuts and spices, coffee and tea.

Six items, namely, textiles and clothing, cut and polished non-industrial diamonds, carpets, shrimps and prawns, footwear, leather goods and cashew nuts, account for about 75% of total Indian exports to the U.S.

There has also been a change in the composition of our imports from the U.S. With India having self sufficient in food-grains, imports of wheat and edible oil from the U.S. on a regular basis have stopped. Crude oil, which was the second highest import item in 1985, has also been virtually phased out. The chief items imported from the U.S. at present are machinery including project items, fertilizers, aircraft and aeronautical equipment, and organic chemicals.

Institutional framework for co-operation

The main joint business group for private sector co-operation is the U.S.-India Business Council that actively organizes promotional events apart from holding annual meetings. The last annual meeting of the U.S.-India Business Council was held on 12-13 June 2000 in San Francisco. Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, Minister for Communications, Secretary Department of Telecom, Finance Secretary, other government officials and a large business delegation from India, attended the meeting. Round table discussions were held on issues covering power & fuel supply, financial services, trade and investment, chemicals and petrochemicals, communications, transportation and knowledge based industries.

General Electric has taken the initiative to set up an India Interest Group with the Washington-based representatives of some major U.S. Corporations as its members. The India Interest Group, the National Association of Manufacturers and the India-U.S. Joint Business Council are participating in the commercial alliance and are also associated with the Private Sector Working Group of the Sub-Commission.

/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000102.jpg,"The Coming of Age of India By Sidharth Bhatia In India, a million revolutions are taking place every day. Long seen as a closed and insular economy and one that stifled enterprise in order to pursue socialist goals, India today is posed to leapfrog into the digital era with great élan and in an almost seamless, effortless way, as if to the manner born. Notwithstanding its rigidity and its slow-growth orientation, the old planned economy pattern had several advantages, not the least of which was to create structural behemoths in the public sector and give India a strong industrial base to stand on. Moreover, during that period, several institutes of academic excellence were set up, which turned out bright engineers and managers by the thousands. Today, India is reaping the benefit of those investments and is gearing up to make a splash in the brave new IT world of tomorrow. The evidence is all around in the country and even outside. The highest number of H1B visas for working in the United States are given to Indians; Silicon Valley, Seattle and other centers of Information Technology development have thousands of Indians working in them; India's own Silicon Plateau, Bangalore, is home to some of the biggest IT companies in the world and thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of bright, creative youngsters are busy setting up dot coms, dreaming of becoming like Bill Gates or Azim Premji, an Indian who is said to be one of the richest men in the world. India is also a big base for off-shore software development and applications—in Gurgaon, which is just on the outskirts of New Delhi, for example, young Indians process the backroom work for large American corporations and international airlines and credit card companies. Some other statistics: India now has nearly 4 million Internet users—a small number compared to many other countries but one which is increasing exponentially by the minute—and by the end of December 2003, the country is projected to have no less than 100 million Internet users. The numbers look even more impressive when compared to November 1998, when there were less than 200000 active net users in India. Recent surveys have shown that over 200 Indian cities are wired to the net and an overwhelming number of users are in the 18 to 24 age group though a full quarter of users are in the economically strong 25-39 age band. Interestingly, pure entertainment is among the lowest priorities for most net users, a clear indication that the Indian users wants to leverage this powerful medium for education and information purposes. E-commerce in India is still in its infancy, but is growing rapidly and today one can buy everything from books, music, cars and even Indian art on the net. India is emerging as one of the biggest sources of domain name registrations in the world. Employment in the dotcom business is upwards of 80000 people within India and this figure is likely to increase by six times in three years or so. This is of course in addition to the thousands of people employed in programming and software development. Not surprisingly, therefore, many countries are heading to India to source their software and personnel requirements. Germany recently declared that it would woo Indian software engineers with a special employment card, while Singapore, Canada and a host of other countries too have been in the forefront of attracting Indian programmers and entrepreneurs. Indian training institutes are setting up shop all over South Asia, South-East Asia and even Africa, teaching programming skills to youngsters all over the world. However, to maintain these impressive growth rates in the IT industry in general and in Internet usage in particular, huge investments will have to be made in infrastructure. The Indian government has shown pragmatism and a liberal attitude towards this sector, allowing private investors to come in and ensuring that India meets all its commitments in dismantling state-owned monopolies in keeping with WTO requirements. At present, much of India's Internet backbone is in the hands of the government-owned Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited but by 2001, 80 private Internet service"

This provision was made in the Patents (Amendment) Act of 1999. Copyright protection in India India has one of the most modern copyright protection laws in the world. Major development in the area of copyright during 1999 was the amendment to the Copyright Act of 1957 to make it fully compatible with the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement. Called the Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1999, this amendment was signed by the President of India on December 30, 1999 and came into force on January 15, 2000. The earlier 1994 amendment to the Copyright Act of 1957 had provided protection to all original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, cinematography, films and sound recordings. It also brought sectors such as satellite broadcasting, computer software and digital technology under Indian copyright protection. The Copyright Act is now in full conformity with the TRIPS obligations. Concern has been expressed about the allegedly slow judicial system in India and the procedural issues involved in trial and conviction. The Indian judiciary is handling cases as expeditiously as possible. The year that has gone by has again witnessed the versatility of the impartial and independent Indian judiciary when it comes to the issue of protection of intellectual property rights, amplified by the encouraging trends with Indian courts plugging in gaps in the statute with the common sense of the common law. Indian enforcement agencies are working effectively and there is a decline in the levels of piracy in India. A summary of these measures is given below: During the year the government continued to stress the need for strict enforcement of the Copyright Act and Rules. State governments and other Ministries were regularly requested to lay special attention to ensuring copyright protection in their functioning. The Government also brought out a Handbook of Copyright Law to create awareness about copyright amongst the stakeholders, enforcement agencies, professional users like the scientific and academic communities and members of the public. Copies of the Handbook were circulated free of cost to the state and central government officials and police personnel and also provided to participants in various seminars and workshops on IPR matters held during the year. National Police Academy and National Academy of Customs, Excise and Narcotics conducted several training programs on copyright for the police and customs officers. Modules on copyright have been included in their regular training programs. The Department of Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has initiated several measures in the past for strengthening the enforcement of copyrights that include constitution of a Copyright Enforcement Advisory Council (CEAC), creation of separate cells in state police headquarters, encouraging setting up of collective administration societies and organization of seminars and workshops to create greater awareness about copyright law among the enforcement personnel and the general public. For collective administration of copyright, copyright societies have been set up for different classes of works. At present there are three registered copyright societies. These are the Society for Copyright Regulations of Indian Producers of Films & Television (SCRIPT) for cinematography films, Indian Performing Rights Society Limited (IPRS) for musical works and Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) for sound recordings. These societies, particularly the PPL and the IPRS, have been quite active in anti-piracy work. The PPL has even set up a special anti-piracy cell under a retired Director General of Police, and this cell has been working in tandem with the police. Several other measures to create general awareness about copyright and for encouraging study of intellectual property rights in the educational system, besides modernizing the Copyright Office, are on the anvil. Consequent to the number of measures initiated by the government, there has been more activity in the enforcement of copyright laws in the country during the last year compared to previous years. As per the data relating to copyright offenses available with the National Crime Records Bureau, the number of copyright cases registered has gone up from 479 in 1997 to 802 in 1998. The number of persons arrested has increased from 794 in 1997 to 980 in 1998. The value of seizures has gone up from Rs. 28.8 million in 1997 to Rs.74.8 million in 1998. These figures reflect the general improvement in the enforcement of the copyright law."

THE Indian software industry has grown from a mere U.S. $150 million in 1991-92 to a staggering U.S. $5.7 billion (including over $4 billion worth of software export) in 1999-2000. No other Indian industry has performed so well against global competition.

The annual growth rate of India's software exports has been consistently over 50 percent since 1991. As per the projections made by the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) for 2000-2001 (April 1, 2000-March 31, 2001), India's software exports would be around $6.3 billion, in addition to $2.5 billion in domestic sale.

Today, India exports software and services to nearly 95 countries around the world. The share of North America (U.S. & Canada) in India's software exports is about 61 per cent. In 1999-2000, more than a third of Fortune 500 companies outsourced their software requirements to India.

NASSCOM's 1999-2000 survey indicates a reversal in the mode of services offered by India. In 1991-92, offshore services accounted for 5 per cent and on-site services 95% of the total exports. However, during 1999-2000 offshore services contributed over 40 percent of the total exports.

The NASSCOM - McKinsey report on India's IT sector

According to a recently released NASSCOM-McKinsey report, annual revenue projections for India's IT industry in 2008 are U.S. $87 billion and market openings are emerging across four broad sectors; IT services, software products, IT enabled services, and e-businesses thus creating a number of opportunities for Indian companies. In addition to the export market, all of these segments have a domestic market component as well.

Other key findings of this report are:

- Software & Services will contribute over 7.5% of the overall GDP growth of India
- IT Exports will account for 35% of the total exports from India
- Potential for 2.2 million jobs in IT by 2008
- IT industry will attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of U.S. $4-5 billion
- Market capitalization of IT shares will be around U.S. $225 billion

The report projects the sector's revenue earnings in 2008 in the following manner:

| $ (US billion) | India | India Centric | Sub total International | Domestic | Total | 1998 |

New Delhi, July 21, 1999

""The Governments of India and the United States today exchanged instruments of ratification for the bilateral Extradition Treaty which was signed by both countries in June 1997. The exchange has brought this treaty into force from today.

The new extradition treaty has replaced the 1931 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom which was, till date, also in force between the United States and India. The treaty is an important step in India-US law enforcement cooperation and cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism. This exchange constitutes yet another milestone in the continuing cooperation between our two democracies to promote the continued growth of our contacts and exchanges in different areas on the basis of mutual benefit and goodwill.""

Salient Points of the Extradition Treaty signed between India and the U.S. in June 1997

Extraditable offenses:

The offense is extraditable if punishable under the laws in both contracting parties by imprisonments for more than one year or by a more severe penalty. This applies:

a) whether or not the laws in the contracting state place the offense within the same category of offenses or describe the offense by the same terminology;

b) whether or not the office is one for which United States federal law requires the showing of such matters as interstate transportation, or use of the mails or of other facilities affecting interstate or foreign commerce, such matters being merely for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction in a United States federal court; or

c) whether or not it relates to taxation or revenue or is one of a purely fiscal character.

Extradition shall be granted for an extraditable offense regardless of where the act or acts constituting the offense were committed.

While extradition shall not be granted for a political offense, the following shall not be considered to be political offenses:

Murder or other willful crime against a Head of State or Head of Government or a member of their family, aircraft hijacking offenses, aviation sabotage, crimes against internationally protected persons including diplomats, hostage taking, offenses related to illegal drugs, or any other offenses for which both contracting states have the obligation to extradite the person pursuant to a multilateral international agreement.

Procedures:

All requests for extradition shall be submitted through the diplomatic channel and be supported by required documents, statements, information describing the facts of the offense, statements of the relevant provisions of the law regarding the offense as well as the punishment, a copy of the warrant or the order of arrest, and such information as would justify the committal for trial of the person in the requested state. For those already convicted of an offense, extradition request shall be supported also by a copy of the judgement of conviction or a statement by a judicial authority that the person has been convicted.

In case of urgency, a contracting state may request the provisional arrest the person sought pending proposal of the request of extradition."

Speech by Sh. Jaswant Singh, Minister of External Affairs at India International Centre on July 20, 1999

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is now time to look ahead; to look beyond Kargil. But even in charting our course for the future we have to assess what Kargil 1999 was all about? What were the challenges — military and diplomatic? What new factors of our total national commitment and endeavour emerged? What lessons for the years that lie ahead? 'Operation Vijay' — as the Prime Minister said some days back — has resulted in 'Vijay' for India. As we re-examine the military and diplomatic challenges that then confronted us, and which were successfully managed, we need to have a preliminary analysis, draw some first conclusions, and above all, looking beyond Kargil, draw a route chart for the tomorrows to come.

First, the military dimension. Kargil was a military aggression by Pakistan, with Pak army regulars, across a stretch of the LoC, in four pockets, from the Mushkoh Valley in the west to Tartuk in the Yaldor-Batalik sector in the East. Initially, with the aggressor — as with all aggressors lay the element of surprise. This was soon countered locally. Initially, the terrain, too, conferred some advantage to the aggressor. They had intruded along ridgelines to occupy some key heights and features that dominated a vital road link, between Dras and Kargil. The depth of the ridges north of the LoC and their gradients, along with nullah approaches enabled the Pakistan army to provide crucial logistical and administrative support to their troops.

The Indian army's response to the military challenge was measured yet swift, it was focussed, thus effective. The first task was to contain the intrusion. For this an accurate assessment was necessary about the degree and extent of it. This involved, amongst other activities the drawing of fire. Simultaneously, a redeployment of troops took place. Through a successful containment of the aggressor's intrusion was ensured the inevitable defeat of this misadventure by Pakistan. The element of surprise was countered by the Indian army through the speed and lethality of its response. On 26th May, the Air Force swung into action in support of the ground operations.

Our military objective had been clearly spelt out to the intruders retreat or the Indian army shall evict you. In any event once the intruder's aim of interfering with the Dras-Kargil Highway had been thwarted the whole rationale of this aggression had got defeated. A mere holding of heights was militarily a counter productive venture. They were bound to be evicted — in detail — one by one; for their occupation served scant military purpose. For India, occupation of territory, south of the LoC, was simply not acceptable both physically and as a violation of a principle. Tactical surprise having been lost early by the aggressor, the military principles of superior force, concentration and firepower were bound to tell. And they did, decisively. This phase of eviction did not, indeed could not be a phase of battles of maneuver. The nature of the terrain, the adversary's dispositions plus most importantly our self-imposed restraints about the LoC, precluded those options. The battles for the heights thus became classic infantry actions in high altitude, combining mountaineering and fighting, against fixed enemy positions at a higher elevation. They were actions that demanded grit, stamina and dauntless courage. Our troops displayed all these qualities in full measure.

Let us be clear about one other vital aspect. This aggression in Kargil sector was by the Pak regular army, it had the logistic and administrative support of not the Pakistani Army alone but of their total state machinery. Secondly, this misadventure was not aimed at infiltrating into the Srinagar Valley, it was to occupy territory in Kargil and in holding that. This purpose, too, was defeated.

The Kargil aggression is not an extension of the problem of terrorism aided and abetted cross border terrorism that we have combated uptill now. It is an"

Addressing the “Conference on Indo-U.S. Trade and Investment — An Agenda for Action”, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Mr. Maran pointed out that although the U.S. was India’s largest trading partner as well as one of the top investors in India, the range of the existing export basket from India continued to be limited with India’s share of U.S. imports estimated at only 0.7%. The vision document signed by Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Clinton aims to institutionalise the India-U.S. commercial dialogue and would deepen ties between the Indian and the U.S. business communities. In pursuance of the joint vision statement signed by the Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee and U.S. President, Mr. William J. Clinton on March 21, India and the U.S. have finalized the Terms of Reference of the India-U.S. Commercial Dialogue. Shri Murasoli Maran, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry on behalf of the Government of India and Mr. William Daley, Secretary, U.S. Department of Commerce, on behalf of the Government of the United States, signed the understanding for Terms of Reference. The Minister said that the commercial dialogue would encompass regular government-to-government meeting in coordination with private sector with the objective of (a) facilitating trade and (b) maximizing investment opportunity across a broad range of economic sectors including information technology, infrastructure, bio-technology and services. The Minister stressed that one of the primary foundations of the new architecture of bilateral relations unveiled in the Vision Statement would be the economic and commercial partnership between the peoples and businesses of the two countries. India-U.S. renewable energy MoU signed A Memorandum of Understanding in the field of renewable energy was signed between the Solar Energy Center of the Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the United States Department of Energy. Shri N.N. Mookerjee, Secretary, Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources and Dr. Ernest J. Moniz, Under Secretary of Energy in the United States Department of Energy signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on behalf of the respective institutions. The MoU envisages cooperation between the Solar Energy Center and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to promote scientific and technological cooperation in the field of renewable energy. The activities proposed to be undertaken under this MoU include strengthening of capacities for energy technology innovation, promoting technologies to increase energy conservation and for a cleaner energy supply. The contribution of U.S. based companies in the power sector in India has been very significant. Out of techno-economically-cleared private power projects, which are having foreign participation, 47 per cent projects have USA based developers are 57 per cent and 80 per cent respectively. The major U.S. power companies like Enron, CMS Generation, General Electric, AES Transpower, Bechtel, Southern Electric, Ogden, PSEG Global etc. are associated with the growth of power sector in the country. It is estimated that in next few years’ investment by U.S. companies in the Indian power sector could cross U.S. $10 billion dollars."

That is why Americans admire India; why we welcome India’s leadership in the region and the world; and why we want to take our partnership to a new level, to advance our common values and interests, and to resolve the differences that still remain.” — President Clinton addressing the Indian Parliament March 22, 2000 India-U.S. Relations: A Vision for the 21st Century At the dawn of a new century, President Clinton and Prime Minister Vajpayee resolve to create a closer and qualitatively new relationship between the United States and India. We are two of the world’s largest democracies. We are nations forged from many traditions and faiths, proving year after year that diversity is our strength. From vastly different origins and experiences, we have come to the same conclusions: that freedom and democracy are the strongest bases for both peace and prosperity, and that they are universal aspirations, constrained neither by culture nor levels of economic development. There have been times in the past when our relationship drifted without a steady course. As we now look towards the future, we are convinced that it is time to chart a new and purposeful direction in our relationship. Globalization is erasing boundaries and building networks between nations and peoples, economies and cultures. The world is increasingly coming together around the democratic ideals India and the United States have long championed and lived by. Together, we represent a fifth of the world’s people, more than a quarter of the world’s economy. We have built creative, entrepreneurial societies. We are leaders in the information age. The currents of commerce and culture that link our societies run strong and deep. In many ways, the character of the 21st century world will depend on the success of our cooperation for peace, prosperity, democracy and freedom. That presents us with an opportunity, but also a profound responsibility to work together. Our partnership of shared ideals leads us to seek a natural partnership of shared endeavors."

we have brought unity. The several languages of
India speak with one voice under the roof of our
Parliament.

In your remarkable experiment as a nation state,
you have proven the same truth. Out of the huddled
masses that you welcomed to your shores you have
created a great nation.

For me the most gratifying of the many achievements of Indian democracy has been the change it
has brought to the lives of the weak and the vulnerable.

To give just one figure, in recent years it has enabled
more than a million women in small towns and
distant villages to enter local elected councils and to
decide on issues that touch upon their lives.

Two years ago, while much of Asia was convulsed
by economic crisis, India held its course.

In the last ten years, we have grown at 6.5 per cent
per year: that puts India among the ten fastest growing economies of the world.

Economic activity gets more and more diversified by
the year: President Clinton and many among the
friends gathered here have had occasion to glimpse
our advances in information technology.

We are determined to sustain the momentum of our
economy: our aim is to double our per capita income in ten years — and that means we must grow
at 9 per cent a year.

To achieve this order of growth we have ushered in
comprehensive reforms. We are committed to releasing the creative genius of our people, the entrepreneurial skills of the men and women of the country, of its scientists and craftsmen. At the same time,
we in India, remain committed to the primacy of the
State in fulfilling its social obligations to the deprived, the weak and the poor.

Important sectors of the country's infrastructure —
power, insurance, banking, telecom — are being
opened to private initiative, domestic and foreign.

Trade barriers are being lowered.

Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen,

There are forces outside our country that believe
that they can use terror to unravel the territorial
integrity of India. They wish to show that a multireligious society cannot exist.

They pursue a task in which they are doomed to fail.

No country has faced as ferocious an attack of terrorist violence as India has over the past two decades:
21,000 were killed by foreign sponsored terrorists in
Punjab alone, 16,000 have been killed in Jammu and
Kashmir.

As many of you here in the Congress have in recent
hearings recognised a stark fact: no region is a greater
source of terrorism than our neighbourhood.

Indeed, in our neighbourhood — in this, the 21st
century — religious war has not just been fashioned
into, it has been proclaimed to be, an instrument of
State policy.

Distance offers no insulation. It should not cause
complacence.

You know, and I know: such evil cannot succeed.

But even in foiling it could inflict untold suffering.

That is why the United States and India have begun
to deepen their cooperation for combating terrorism.
We must redouble these efforts.

Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen,

There was a time when we were on the other side
of each other's globes. Today, on the digital map,
India and the United States are neighbours and partners.

India and the United States have taken the lead in
shaping the information age. Over the last decade,
this new technology has sustained American prosperity in a way that has challenged conventional
wisdom on economic growth.

We are two nations blessed with extraordinary
resources and talent. Measured in terms of the industries of tomorrow, we are together defining the
partnerships of the future.

But our two countries have the potential to do more
to shape the character of the global economy in this
century.

We should turn the example of our own cooperation
into a partnership that uses the possibilities of the
new technologies for defining new ways of fighting
poverty, illiteracy, hunger, disease and pollution."

Social Welfare

Increased Focus On Elimination Of Child Labor

Elimination of child labor continues to be one of the major focus areas of the Labor Ministry. The Labor Ministry has taken an initiative for framing an omnibus legislation prescribing 14 years as the minimum age for employment and work in all occupations. However, exception is sought in the area of agriculture in family and smallholdings producing for own consumption. The proposed legislation will also fix a minimum age of not less than 18 years to any type of employment and work which by its nature or circumstances is likely to jeopardize the health, safety or morals of young persons. The measure would also help in ratification of the ILO's new convention, by India.

Welfare Fund For Overseas Indian Workers

The Labor Ministry proposes to constitute a Welfare Fund for the Indian Overseas Workers. It will be utilized for repatriating the workers stranded in foreign countries, providing financial assistance to the kin of workers who die during foreign employment, transportation home of the bodies of dead workers and for lump sum assistance to workers permanently disabled while in foreign employment. Collecting a fee from each worker leaving the country for overseas employment will raise the money for the Fund. The Labor Ministry is also taking several steps to prevent exploitation of emigrant workers both at home and abroad. The Chief Secretaries of all the states have been requested to ensure police surveillance on the activities of unauthorized agents and register cases against them.

President K.R. Narayanan Visits France and China

President K.R. Narayanan's visit to France during April 2000 was the first ever-official visit by an Indian president to France. President Narayanan's visit, which included stops in Paris, Toulouse and Angion, confirmed a ""common desire to develop a close partnership"" between the two countries.

French President Jacques Chirac spoke enthusiastically of his hopes for a ""strategic partnership"" between India and France, a partnership for the 21st century,"" in evoking the close ties, both political and cultural, between the two democracies. The French have often dreamed of India."" Chirac stated in a long speech, which paid homage to the rich cultural heritage of the Asian nation and to the country's espousal of the democratic principles it shares with France. Chirac spoke of being at ""the dawn of a new century which will be in particular that of Asia,"" stressing the importance of mutual cooperation and communication between the two nations.

The first stage of the visit took place in Paris on April 17, where President Narayanan and his wife were received as guests of honor at a state dinner. The meeting between the Presidents highlighted the close ties that have been established between the two countries in the realms of science and industry, the environment, and culture, evoking such projects as the ""Forum for Franco-Indian Initiative"" and the ""Franco-Indian Week,"" dedicated to the problem of water shortages.

President Chirac stressed the rich cultural heritage of India, which he credited with the inspiration for France's own artistic tradition: ""Few countries have more greatly inspired our writers, our philosophers, our artists.""

But the talks focused mainly on international relations. President Chirac declared that the international equilibrium has need of a strong relationship between India and the European Union. One of the most important issues on the agenda was that of nuclear disarmament, a cause to which both heads of state have publicly committed themselves.

President Chirac emphasized France's desire to see India occupy a prominent place in the international scene. Both leaders agreed on the importance of enhancing cooperation in the domain of defense.

President K.R. Narayanan returned June 3, 2000 from a landmark visit to China aimed at improving ties between the world's two most populous nations. Vice President Krishnan Kant, Home Minister L.K. Advani and other cabinet ministers received Mr. Narayanan and wife on their return from the weeklong trip. The President during his visit held talks with his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji, Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee chief Li Ruihuan, and met with Chinese Parliament chamberli Li Peng. Narayanan and Jiang agreed that the two neighboring countries should work for an early and reasonable resolution to their vexed boundary issue."

S&T cooperation between India and USA is characterized by over five decades of successful and productive exchange of scientists and scientific ideas, joint/collaborative research projects, training/fellowship programs and technology transfer in virtually all areas of Science & Technology.

In the late 1950's, Indian and American scientists began to collaborate on agricultural research. This activity was expanded in the 1960's into other fields of science and education.

Visible Institutional Symbols:

The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, an internationally renowned institute for technical education and research, was set up with U.S. cooperation.

Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, which played a pivotal role in India's green revolution in 1960's, successful collaboration with Ohio State University, USA.

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)-an apex body for education-was set up with American collaboration.

Some Milestones:

1974: The S&T Sub-commission was established within the Indo-US Joint Commission on Economics and Commerce, Science & Technology, Education & Culture, and Agriculture. The S&T Sub-Commission had seven Working Groups in different areas: Material & Physical Sciences, Earth Sciences, Atmospheric & Marine Sciences, Energy, Environment Ecology, Information S&T, Health, Medical and Life Sciences.

1983: A new fast track cooperation program, the S&T Initiative (STI), was established to enhance cooperation in areas of agriculture, health, monsoon research, biomass research and engineering, and solid state sciences. The National Science Foundation (NSF), USA and the Department of Science & Technology (DST), India, were the nodal agencies in implementing the program, which operated on cost sharing basis. The U.S.-India Fund (USEF) was established to carry out joint activities such as workshops exchange of scientists and experts, joint research programs in fields of educational, cultural and sciences. USIF was initially set up for ten years but was extended by a year. The Indian scientific community benefited from this program, with more than 50 workshops and about 140 joint scientific projects. As of December 1998, there were more than 200 ongoing projects with cumulative cost of Rs. 645 million.

1987: An MOU is signed for the Vaccine Action Program under the Health, Medical and Life Sciences Working Group of the U.S.-India S&T Sub-Commission. The program is now in its third phase, and is extended until 2002. The last meeting of the joint Working Group was held in July 2000, in Washington, DC to identify the focus areas for further research in vaccine development and allied areas. A similar program exists on cooperation on contraceptive and reproductive health research.

1991: The S&T fellowship program supported by U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Department of Science & Technology, Government of India. Under this program 70 Indian scientists spent 3-12 months in the USA and 10 US scientists came to India. The program continued till 1994.

1993: Indo-U.S. S&T agreement is proposed but could not be signed due to differences over intellectual property rights provisions.

1997: The Vaccine Action Program is extended up to 2002.

1997: A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for scientific cooperation in the area of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences was signed between the Department of Space (DOS) and the Department of Science and Technology (DST) of the Government of India and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States on December 16, 1997.

Specific areas of cooperation include weather analysis and forecasting techniques; satellite product development for atmospheric, land and ocean parameters, applications to flood forecasting and drought monitoring.

The MOU provides for exchange of data and derived products between the two countries from Indian National Satellite (INSAT) as well as Geostationary"

In the early 1960's, the United States had offered substantial assistance to India in setting up an Equatorial Rocket Launching Station at Thumba (TERLS). Subsequently, India dedicated this facility to the United Nations in 1968. Since then, scientists from various countries have launched more than 3000 sounding rockets for research purposes.

During 1975-76, under a collaborative bilateral agreement, an experiment, Satellite Instrumental Television Experiment (SITE) was conducted. Under this agreement, a U.S. satellite, ATS-6, beamed educational programs to direct reception television sets to 2400 far flung villages exposing them to a new and immensely powerful medium of television.

Anuradha, an Indian experiment for cosmic ray studies was part of NASA's third Spacelab mission.

The Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG) and Survey of India have made use of data received from NASA's MAGSAT Satellite for research and analysis.

India has also participated in Guest Investigator Program of NASA's Einstein and HEAO-B X-ray astronomy satellites.

The United States supplied samples of lunar material collected by its lunar probes to India for research purposes.

Under a Memorandum of Understanding between India and U.S. signed in 1977, India received data from LANDSAT satellites.

Under a commercial arrangement, Space Imaging of Denver, CO markets the Indian Remote Sensing satellite images of panchromatic resolution of 5m — which until recently has been the best available in the public domain.

In 1997, NASA & NDAA of United States and Indian Space Research Organization & the Department of Science and Technology of India have agreed to share meteorological data from India's INSAT satellites. Under this agreement, collaborative research in the area of earth & atmospheric sciences will also be undertaken.

and the print media, in fully informing and mobilizing public opinion, was an invaluable part of the total national effort to meet the challenge of Kargil.

Why did Pakistan undertake such an ill-conceived misadventure? Perhaps, they thought that they could translate the advantage of tactical surprise into a strategic gain by bringing about a defacto realignment of the LoC, in the region, thus rendering the Srinagar-Leh National Highway vulnerable. They were wrong. They miscalculated India's resolve, they did not comprehend the sense of national outrage at this blatant breach of trust, the sheer motivation of the Indian soldiers and the leadership quality of the Indian Army officers who led from the front.

Perhaps, Pakistan calculated on provoking India into an escalation. They were wrong again because the decision of not crossing the LoC was taken early and maintained scrupulously, in the face of high casualties and even when the decision to employ air power was taken. The area of conflict was not expanded. Pakistan having disowned its troops as ""freedom fighters"", could hardly thereafter have opened up a new front, to ease pressure in Kargil.

What of the future? Looking beyond Kargil provides us an opportunity to renew our faith in ourselves, our society, our policy and our nation. It compels us to look ahead in all fields of national endeavour but particularly, in the spheres of national security and foreign policy. One simple message emanating from Kargil is that adequate resources have to be made available for national defence, that the kind of relegation of defence needs that we witnessed in the late eighties and nineties is unsound policy, that technological upgradation cannot be postponed, that the nation must always think of the welfare of those who are in the first rank of its defence.

Kargil has many pointers for our foreign policy and diplomacy too. As in the present instance, we should always be ready to engage with the world as full and responsible members of the international community, but, of course, keeping our national priorities and interests as the guiding principle; we ought to have no reluctance, leave alone fear, in engaging with the world on any issue. Indeed, we serve the national interest when we engage the world on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Such engagement is the very substance of diplomacy. That is not any internationalization of an issue. Nor does it imply mediation or any acceptance of intermediaries.

Issues have to be addressed bilaterally between concerned countries, and in the case of India and Pakistan, that is what the Lahore process is all about. We would like to renew that process and we would like Pakistan to facilitate a resumption of the process, by reaffirming the inviolability and sanctity of the Line of Control. Clearly, a sponsorship of terrorism across the Line of Control, or elsewhere, is a violation of the Line of Control, as indeed of Simla Agreement and Lahore Declaration. There is a need, for Pakistan, to abjure sponsoring, aiding or abetting cross-border terrorism. These are not any pre-conditions for dialogue. We are after all, the initiators of this dialogue process and our commitment to it is firm and abiding. But it is only right for our nation, at this juncture, to expect that Pakistan will repair the damage that it has done to trust, that it demonstrates this through concrete and tangible steps. Trust is not built by engaging in dialogue in winter and committing aggression in summer. Continuous calls for Jihad can also hardly be read as messages for dialogue and peace. And it is in this vein that I suggest that high pitched propaganda against India also does not inspire confidence in Pakistan's interest in dialogue.

I would venture to suggest that Pakistan, too, has to come to terms with its history, as indeed with its geography. It has to realize that there simply is no military solution to what it presumably is its locus-standii in Jammu and Kashmir. It is, of course, for Pakistan to determine its priorities but fomenting religious fundamentalism can hardly be employed as a tool against want and poverty. India recognizes the permanence of the sovereign state of Pakistan and that is final. While India remains ready for dialogue, the pace at which it can move forward will depend entirely on when and how the state of Pakistan, and what it has now become, permits it to do so.

Our foreign policy has not been fixated on Pakistan, but that has been a significant preoccupation"

of Information Technology (MIT) has launched a program ""Operation Knowledge"" to be implemented by June 2001. The Ministry has begun preparing a blueprint on finding out ways and means to meet the demand for Indian Info Tech professionals and a draft would be ready within a month, Minister for Information Technology Pramod Mahajan has said. The draft, which would be referred to the Ministries of Human Resources Development and Finance, would be submitted to the Prime Minister by the end of this year after incorporating inputs from these ministries he said. According to MIT projections, there would be a demand for 2.2 million skilled manpower in the software sector by 2008, while there would be direct employment opportunities for 1.6 million professionals in the hardware sector. Additionally, there would be indirect employment opportunities for 3.2 million personnel in the hardware sector by the same period, taking the total global demand for Indian IT professionals to seven million. Mahajan said the operation knowledge would be incorporated in the next Budget providing enough funds for implementation by June 2001.

Government to prepare minimum Agenda for E-Governance

In a bid to push e-governance within the government, the High Powered Committee on Improving Administrative Efficiency using IT would prepare a minimum agenda for e-governance within a month, Cabinet Secretary Prabhat Kumar said. ""The Committee would prepare a transparent, efficient agenda for e-governance including methods to automate government-citizen interface,"" Kumar said. He said the objective of the minimum agenda would be to serve the two-way process of evolving an efficient network- ing between government departments and bring about transparency in Government functioning. The thrust of the agenda would be to operationalize the IT services within government departments, he said adding the committee would face no hitch from any of the concerned ministries including the ministry of Finance. ""If the expenditure of the agenda crosses the earmarked budget, the High Powered Committee would also consider providing additional funds,"" Kumar said. Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Planning and Program Implementation Arun Shourie said to make e-governance a success, the committee should take initiatives to start online transactions so that public could directly deal with various government departments.

sary of the Shakti tests, India has taken the lead to put forward pragmatic proposals to harmonise the concerns of the NPT-community with the long-term goals of nuclear disarmament. External affairs minister Jaswant Singh has timed his proposals in Parliament to prod the nations now assembled in New York for the first quinquennial review conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty after the legitimisation of nuclear weapons in 1995. New Delhi’s aim is to stimulate some fresh thinking on the issue. Mr Singh emphasised that India would not give up its nuclear arsenal so long as the five nuclear weapon nations keep theirs; whether the NPT nations acknowledge India’s status as a weapons nation or not will make no difference to the effectiveness and significance of the capability. The NPT community has run out of ideas and is dangerously poised to unleash a new arms race; the US proposal to initiate a national missile defence programme will have adverse implications for the entire arms control structure. The Indian foreign minister has offered a step-by-step approach towards fulfilling the obligations under Article VI of the NPT to achieve ultimate nuclear disarmament.

True Confessions

The U.S. state department’s assessment in its annual report on international terrorism shifting the hub of terrorism from West Asia to the Pakistan-Afghanistan region should not come as a surprise. Only recently, U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright acknowledged the short-sightedness of supporting Saddam Hussein in his aggression against Iran; thanks to the U.S. intervention in Iran in 1953, that country had to bear Shah’s tyranny for 25 years. President Clinton during his trip to Bangladesh regretted that its struggle for freedom did not get the deserved support for many nations. He was no doubt referring impliedly to the U.S. Now a decade after Pakistan unleashed terrorism in this region and started to Talibanise Afghanistan, the U.S. has come round to the view that this region is the focal point of international terrorism fuelled by religious extremism and narcotics traffic.

Patent excuse

Everyone has a right over the knowledge they create. Which is not the same thing as having proprietorial rights over a traditional knowledge that already exists.

Unfortunately, the patent regime under the auspices of the WTO has failed to distinguish the two. The wrangle over them is a typical example of the problems that are being faced. The products of this plant have been used in India down the ages for medicinal and other purposes. But that has not stopped over three dozen American companies from rushing to the patent office to register their proprietorial rights over using them in some or other form.

The European Patent Office rejected one such “neem patent” granted to an American company earlier this week. This should help draw attention to some of the injurious aspects of the existing regime. While the verdict should be welcome news for all users of traditional knowledge in societies such as India, it must be borne in mind that it has taken an India-based NGO four years to make its case before the EPO on this issue. As far as the present patent system goes, the dice are loaded against traditional societies, most of which are struggling with their developmental problems.

Back to the future

Gradual restoration of Indo-Russian relations to the levels which existed between India and the Soviet Union is a strategically desirable long-term objective. While forging such an equation with Russia, India has to calibrate its relations with the U.S. and China in a manner where India retains her independent position and freedom of options in dealing with the U.S., China and Russia.

The long-term predication on which India should structure relations with Russian Federation is that if Russia re-consolidates itself and becomes stable politically and economically, it will remain endowed with nearly 70 per cent of the resources, man-power and technological capacities of the former Soviet Union. Russia’s demographic and geo-territorial characteristics make it a power to reckon with in Eurasian land mass. As far as India is concerned, Russia has an interest in balancing the influence of the U.S. and extremist Islamic nations in the Asian region. Ivanov’s visit affirms that on this objective Russian and Indian interests converge. The revival of Indo-Russian connections is based on this convergence of long-term interests of both the countries.

We will engage in regular consultations on, and work together for, strategic stability in Asia and beyond. We will bolster joint efforts to counter terrorism and meet other challenges to regional peace. We will strengthen the international security system, including in the United Nations, and support the United Nations in its peacekeeping efforts. We acknowledge that tensions in South Asia can only be resolved by the nations of South Asia. India is committed to enhancing cooperation, peace and stability in the region. India and the United States share a commitment to reducing and ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons, but we have not always agreed on how to reach this common goal. The United States believes India should forgo nuclear weapons. India believes that it needs to maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent in keeping with its own assessment of its security needs. Nonetheless, India and the U.S. are prepared to work together to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. To this end, we will persist with and build upon the productive bilateral dialogue already underway. We reaffirm our respective voluntary commitments to forgo further nuclear explosive tests. We will work together and with others for an early commencement of negotiations on a treaty to end the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. We have both shown strong commitments to export controls, and will continue to strengthen them. We will work together to prevent the spread of dangerous technologies. We are committed to build confidence and reduce the chances of miscalculation. We will pursue our security needs in a restrained and responsible manner, and will not engage in nuclear and missile arms races. We will seek to narrow our differences and increase mutual understanding on non-proliferation and security issues. This will help us to realize the full potential of Indo-U.S. relations and contribute significantly to regional and global security. The true measure of our strength lies in the ability of our people to shape their destiny and to realize their aspirations for a better life. That is why the United States and India are and will be allies in the cause of democracy. We will share our experience in nurturing and strengthening democratic institutions the world over and fighting the challenge to democratic order from forces such as terrorism. We will cooperate with others to launch an international Community of Democracies this year. The United States applauds India’s success in opening its economy, its achievements in science and technology, its commitment to a new wave of economic expansion and reform, and its determination to bring the benefits of economic growth to all its people. Our nations pledge to reduce impediments to bilateral trade and investment and to expand commerce between us, especially in the emerging knowledge-based industries and high-technology areas. We will work together to preserve stability and growth in the global economy as well. And we will join in an unrelenting battle against poverty in the world, so that the promise of a new economy is felt everywhere and no nation is left behind. That is among the fundamental challenges of our time. Opening trade and resisting protectionism are the best means for meeting it. We support an open, equitable and transparent rule-based multilateral trading system, and we will work together to strengthen it. We agree that developed countries should embrace policies that offer developing countries the opportunity to grow, because growth is the key to rising incomes and rising standards. At the same time, we share the conviction that human development also requires empowerment of people and availability of basic freedoms. As leaders in the forefront of the new high-technology economy, we recognize that countries can achieve robust economic growth while protecting the environment and taking action to combat climate change. We will do our part to meet the global environmental challenges, including climate change and the impacts of air and water pollution on human health. We also pledge a common effort to battle the infectious diseases that kill people and retard progress in so many countries. India is at the forefront of the global effort that has brought us to the threshold of the eradication of polio. With leadership, joint research, and application of modern science, we can and will do the same for the leading killers of our time, including AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We are proud of the cooperation between Indians and Americans in advancing frontiers of knowledge. But even as we unravel the mysteries of time and space, we must continue to apply our knowledge to older challenges: eradicating human suffering, disease and poverty. In the past, our cooperation helped ease mass hunger in the world. In the future, it will focus as well on the development of clean energy, health, and education. Our partnership is not an end in itself, but a means to all these ends. And it is reinforced by the ties of scholarship, commerce, and increasingly of kinship among our people. The industry, enterprise and cultural contributions of Americans of Indian heritage have enriched and enlivened both our societies."

It is also a matter of much satisfaction that the past year has seen a record low in communal violence.

India is the largest democracy in the world. The tradition of democracy in our country is very old. When this Century opened, democracy was the preserve of just a handful of countries, and even in them it was limited to small sections of the people. Today there are just a handful who are still out of the pale of democracy. There is scarcely a country whose people do not aspire to it.

Come, let us strengthen Indian democracy. Let us make it an ideal for other countries of the world. Let us transform our political democracy into economic and social democracy.

Come, let us make India a nation of high achievers — in every sphere. In business and economy, in education, in science and technology, in arts and culture, and also in sports. Let us make India synonymous with ""achievement"", achievement of the kind that can be beheminded globally. All of us are heartened by what our young men and women have achieved in recent times. The success stories of young Indians working abroad are making head- lines almost every day. If young Indians can script such shining successes abroad, why shouldn't we create conditions for them to do so right here?

Come let us together build a Parishram Bharat, a Parakramli Bharat, a Vijayli Bharat.

To realize this vision, let us step out of the swamp of negativity.

Let us not be obsessed with the past. Face the future. March with confidence towards the goal. Turn from problems — to solutions.

Today, when the 20th century is coming to an end, and the 21st century is knocking at our doorsteps, let us draw inspiration from our glorious past and resolve to build an even more glorious future.

We are inheritors of an ageless culture and a proud civilization. Greatness is our past — and also our future.

Come, let us make good use of the natural and human resources of our Motherland, Bharat and make the 21st century, India's century.

Come, let all of us together raise our voice in saying:

Excerpts from Ambassador Naresh Chandra's Chat on Rediff on the Net — August 11, 1999

Q. ""Dear Mr. Chandra, congratulations to you and your staff at Washington, DC for doing such a wonderful job in presenting India's case during the Kargil crisis. What do you think the NRI community in the US should do to better represent India?""

A. ""Thank you for your good wishes. People of Indian origin and NRIs are doing a great job and all I can suggest is that all should keep themselves informed and interact meaningfully with our American friends to point out areas of mutual interest and concerns. This way we can utilize Indo-US relationships for the benefit of the South Asia region as a whole.""

Q. ""Hello Mr. Chandra, hearty congratulations to you on a job well done. Sir, what repercussions do you see to India downing a Pakistani surveillance plane? In fact, today they have fired a missile at us. Do you agree that the main battle will be won on the diplomatic front? Are we prepared for it?""

A. ""Thank you. I agree with you that a solution does not lie in military activity. Diplomacy is a better option, but the best option is to improve people-to-people relations. There is a lot of goodwill in India for people in Pakistan and I am sure many sections of Pakistani people reciprocate this feeling. What we have to prepare for, is to do everything possible to counter misinformation and propaganda and promote more understanding between the peoples for their mutual benefit and development.""

Q. ""Mr. Chandra, India has been at odds with Pakistan since Independence. . . . How do you see us resolving our differences? Is there a middle road? What In your opinion is the best solution? Why can't we demarcate the border properly once and for all?""

A. ""It is unfortunate that India and Pakistan have been at odds but believe me there is a middle road and the people of South Asia are increasingly realising that their future lies in cooperation and economic development. To reach this best solution, we have to counter terrorist and propaganda activity, ie, discourage the wrong set of people and encourage the more responsible sections for our mutual benefit.""

Q. ""Hello Mr. Chandra. It is true that Kargil has indeed changed US perceptions towards India — albeit to a small extent? That is certainly encouraging. But do use — the Government of India, the diplomatic corps and you people on the spot who are the pointsmen — have the big picture in mind? A comprehensive strategy to put India-US relations on a truly collaborative course? If so, what are its salient features?""

A. US perceptions about India and Pakistan have been changing for some time. Kargil only helped to bring it out into the open. The US and other Western countries as well as China are concerned at the growth of fanaticism and fundamentalism in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Kargil was the latest example of a very dangerous nexus between terrorists and a professional army. This has alarmed most countries who in a friendly way are also deeply concerned about its adverse effects on Pakistani society itself. We have the big picture in mind and our attempt is not to show Pakistan down but to normalise the situation and bring about the necessary atmosphere for meaningful dialogue and cooperation with them. That is the big picture we have for India-Pakistan and other people in South Asia."""

Q: Ambassador Chandra, today the President in particular called on India and Pakistan not to take this vote as a green light to step up your nuclear weapons program. How do you read it?

NARESH CHANDRA: Well, we have already made an announcement at prime minister's level that we have taken a decision not to test anymore. In fact, the announcement was made on the 13th of May '98, by my government. And the Prime Minister of India reiterated our approach to CTBT in the UN General Assembly and also in Parliament. We don't oppose and we have said that we are working to reach arrangements with our friendly powers, including the P-Five - in order not to -

Q: You're talking about the big five nuclear powers?

NARESH CHANDRA: Nuclear powers. So we have said that we will try reach an understanding so that we don't stand in the way of the treaty going into force.

Q: All right. But are you saying, one, that India will continue to adhere to your own sort of voluntary ban on testing?

NARESH CHANDRA: That's true.

Q: And what about signing this treaty, which India has not done?

NARESH CHANDRA: Well, we are in the stage of evolving a consensus inside India. And this process has got delayed because we had a general election, which lasted a long time. The new government has taken oath of office yesterday, and it's a priority for them to determine their approach now and the future on the signing on the CTBT.

Q: Ambassador Chandra, what about the point — or how do you respond to the point that Senator Levin made; that is, setting aside perhaps India for a moment, but that it is difficult for the United States to have the moral authority now to call on other countries either not to test or to sign or ratify the treaty when the U.S. hasn't done the latter?

Well, there are two aspects: One is the treaty ratification. The other is the U.S. policy as enunciated by the President and executed. It is true that non-ratification will have a bearing on the strength that the U.S. administration would have had in persuading other powers to their point of view. At the same time, the fact that the President has indicated that his policy of non-testing and continuing commitment to the treaty would lend them some weight there. As far as India is concerned, for us the debate in the Senate is a very important input for our deliberations. When we consider about signing the CTBT, the debate in the Senate, the observations which have been made will be very carefully taken into account. But the ultimate test, whether we sign or not, there is only one criteria, and that is the national security interests of the Indian people. It is on that test that parliament and government of India will decide whether to sign the test ban treaty or not.

Q: Do you see, Mr. Ambassador, a United States that's disengaging from the world at all?

NARESH CHANDRA: I would put it this way. In every democracy, both points of view are present in the national parliament or in the Congress. And it depends on which point, what point of view prevails because politics is essentially local, and nobody can blame elected representatives from keeping a sharp eye on what the voters' interest is. So it's a case of a balance. I think in the national parliament, people expect that a much broader view is taken. So there is a balance between isolationists' view and the world view."

Gandhi Likeness Unveiled by Vajpayee and Clinton

Washington's newest statue, a larger-than-life figure of Mahatma Gandhi, was officially dedicated yesterday by President Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in a small park across from the Indian Embassy on Massachusetts Avenue NW.

""It's very important for the United States to make a memorial to Gandhi,"" Clinton said after the dedication. ""Gandhi provided the inspiration to Martin Luther King, which spread to the civil rights movement and brought an end to the business of slavery and brought integrity to the democratic ideal.""

The statue, just under nine feet tall, stands on a 16-ton block of rough-hewn granite from India. It shows a lean, bespectacled Gandhi in full stride, pushing forward against a walking stick in a scene recalling his 1930 march to the sea to protest an increased salt tax by the British.

The robed, sandaled figure faces north, toward the British Embassy about a mile away. The inscription below it is spare: ""My Life Is My Message.""

The president said that last week's visit by the prime minister enhanced the relationship between their countries and that he hopes ""this chain in partnership goes beyond my service into a whole new era of U.S.-India relations."" No other country ""has been more influenced by India than the United States,"" said Clinton, who learned about Gandhi at 17 or 18 through King's writings about nonviolent resistance.

Vajpayee visit marks changing relationship between U.S., India

""We are the oldest democracy. They are the world's biggest democracy,"" said White House national security spokesman P.J. Crowley. ""There is an opportunity here to have a qualitatively new relationship with India.""

As if to underscore that point, Vajpayee's visit will also showcase the growing and increasingly prosperous community of Indian-Americans, who include Hotmail founder Sabeer Bhatia and Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Kholsa. Vajpayee is scheduled to attend a private reception of Indian-Americans Saturday night, and he'll presumably be talking to the dozens of Internet entrepreneurs in the crowd about investing in his country.

Prime Minister Vajpayee on India-U.S. Relations:

""President Clinton and I have just signed a vision statement. The statement outlines the contours of and defines the agenda of our partnership in the 21st century. We both agreed that our commitment to the principles and practice of democracy constitutes the bedrock of our relations and for our cooperative efforts internationally for peace, prosperity and democratic freedom.""

Terrorism:

""We share a common concern at the growing threat of terrorist violence and its links with religious extremism and illegal trade in narcotics. Both of us expressed our firm opposition to the use of any form of violence, whether as an instrument of terror against democratic society or as a means of realizing territorial ambition. Nothing justifies the use of such matters against innocent people. We expressed our determination to intensify our cooperation in this area.""

Disarmament:

""President Clinton and I had a frank discussion on the issues of disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The dialogue which is in progress between our two countries on these issues has enhanced the mutual understanding of our respective concerns. I've explained to President Clinton the reasons that compel us to maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent. I have reiterated our firm commitment not to conduct further nuclear explosive tests, not to engage in a nuclear arms race, and not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against any country.""

President Bill Clinton on India-U.S. Relations:

""I have come to India because I want us to build a dynamic and lasting partnership, based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. India and America should be better friends and stronger partners. In a world of increasing globalization, our futures plainly are intertwined.""

Terrorism:

""I recognize that India has real security concerns. We certainly share your outrage and heartbreak over last night's brutal attack in Kashmir. We offer our profoundest sympathies to the people, especially to the families of the victims. It reminds us of what tremendous suffering this conflict has caused India. The violence must end. This should be a time for restraint, for respect for the line of control, for renewed lines of communication.""

Disarmament:

""I felt today that there was a possibility that we could reach more common ground on the issues of testing on the production of fissile material, on export controls and on restraint, generally.

With regard to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, you heard the Prime Minister's statement about his position on testing. I would hope that the democratic process will produce a signing and ultimately a ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban in India, just like I hope the democratic process will ultimately produce a ratification of the Test Ban Treaty in America that I signed.

(Continued from page 3)

Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen,

We believe that India and America can — and should — march hand in hand towards a world in which economic conditions improve for all.

A situation that provides comfortable living standards to one-third of the world's population, but condemns the remaining two-thirds to poverty and want, is unsustainable.

The foremost responsibility that the 21st century has cast on all of us is to change this unacceptable legacy of the past.

It should be our common endeavour to overcome this legacy. I, therefore, propose a comprehensive global dialogue on development.

We would be happy to offer New Delhi as the venue for this dialogue.

In this Congress, you have often expressed concern about the future contours of Asia. Will it be an Asia that will be at peace with itself? Or will it be a continent, where countries seek to redraw boundaries and settle claims — historical or imaginary — through force?

We seek an Asia where power does not threaten stability and security. We do not want the domination of some to crowd out the space for others. We must create an Asia where cooperative rather than aggressive assertion of national self-interests defines behaviour among nations.

If we want an Asia fashioned on such ideals — a democratic, prosperous, tolerant, pluralistic, stable Asia — if we want an Asia where our vital interests are secure, then it is necessary for us to re-examine old assumptions.

It is imperative for India and the United States to work together more closely in pursuit of those goals. In the years ahead, a strong, democratic and economically prosperous India, standing at the crossroads of all the major cultural and economic zones of Asia, will be an indispensable factor of stability in the region.

Our cooperation for peace and stability requires us to also define the principles of our own engagement. We must be prepared to accommodate our respective concerns.

We must have the mutual confidence to acknowledge our respective roles and complementary responsibilities in areas of vital importance to each of us.

Security issues have cast a shadow on our relationship. I believe this is unnecessary. We have much in common and no clash of interests.

We both share a commitment to ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons. We have both declared voluntary moratoriums on testing.

India understands your concerns. We do not wish to unravel your non-proliferation efforts. We wish you to understand our security concerns.

We are at a historic moment in our ties. As we embark on our common endeavour to build a new relationship, we must give practical shape to our shared belief that democracies can be friends, partners and allies.

In recent years, through all the good and difficult times, we have spoken to each other more often than we have ever done in the past. I thank President Clinton for this leadership and vision in steering this dialogue. I sincerely thank members of this Congress for supporting and encouraging this process.

As we talk with candour, we open the doors to new possibilities and new areas of cooperation — in advancing democracy, in combating terrorism, in energy and environment, science and technology and in international peacekeeping. And, we are discovering that our shared values and common interests are leading us to seek a natural partnership of shared endeavours.

India and the United States have taken a decisive step away from the past. The dawn of the new century has marked a new beginning in our relations.

Let us work to fulfill the promise and the hope of today.

Let us remove the shadow of hesitation that lies between us and our joint vision.

Let us use the strength of all that we have in common to build together a future that we wish for ourselves and for the world that we live in.

Thank you."

Ambassador Naresh Chandra Meets Members of India Interest Group

September 10, 1999

The Ambassador, Naresh Chandra, held a meeting with members of the India Interest Group. A large number of representatives of US companies and business organizations attended the meeting. Senior officials of the Embassy and representatives of FICCI, CII and State Bank of India were also present.

Briefing members on the current political and economic scene in India, the Ambassador mentioned that in spite of the Kargil conflict and the announcement of parliamentary elections, the share market index was up and the economy continued to do well. Most macro-indicators have been favourable in the last few months. Inflation, for example, is at an all-time low and the rising stock market index reflects continued investor confidence in the economy. The reform process did get interrupted in some cases where legislation was involved, like the opening up of insurance sector, but this is likely to be temporary. India would have a new parliament soon and whichever party formed the Government, it was likely to carry forward the programme of liberalisation, the Ambassador emphasised.

Touching on key issues in Indo-US relations, Ambassador Chandra mentioned that Senator Brownback and Congressman Gilman have proposed waiver of US sanctions under the Glenn Amendment and the matter would now be decided in conference between the Senate and the House. While these moves are welcome, he said, there are two concerns relating to waiver of sanctions which should be noted. First, there is a strong feeling among the Indian American community here that Pressler Amendment should not be repealed. Most analysts also agree that it would send a very wrong signal so soon after the misadventure in Kargil. Secondly, the entities list issued by the Bureau of Export Administration is so long and wide in its scope that it is a major hurdle in developing a more fruitful economic relationship between our two countries. This had adversely affected US exports to India.

In the interaction that ensued, members of the India Interest Group raised issues regarding the likely political scenario after elections in India and its effect on economic policies. Ambassador Chandra pointed out that the Indian political situation is undergoing a transformation and all parties appeared to have broadened their perspectives. Two important political groupings have emerged, but on economic issues there is a clear consensus on continuing the policy of liberalisation in the country's best interest.

There was discussion on the entities list issued by the Bureau of Export Administration. Some members stated that they have been pointing out to the US Administration that it is disproportionately wide in its scope that hurts business interests on both sides. They felt that there should be an exit policy that enables entities to get off the list and stated that they have been emphasising this need with the US Administration. The Ambassador welcomed these observations and stated that the Embassy and the US corporate sector can work together on this.

Some members representing US telecom and energy companies felt that India should take a more positive line in the WTO negotiations. Given India's increasingly liberal economic policy at home, the somewhat rigid approach taken in the multilateral trade forums, they felt, reflected a needlessly rigid and narrow approach. The Ambassador pointed out that the Government of India has been moving quite rapidly in removing trade restrictions and stated that the Embassy would be happy to work with US companies to develop an approach which will be in conformity with India's national interests and include all WTO-related issues, including trans-national movement of persons. At the Seattle Conference in November 1999, India's Commerce Minister would be leading the delegation and some positions could be formulated before that meeting.

In his concluding remarks, Mr. Michael Gadbaw, President of India Interest Group, appreciated the initiative of the Ambassador to regularly meet with the US corporate sector. He stated that it provided a very useful forum for exchanging views. He proposed for Ambassador Chandra's consideration that the next meeting be held soon after the formation of the new Government. This was agreed to."
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000138.jpg,"Indian Americans - A Story of Achievement

There are now more than 1.5 million peoples of Indian origin in America. They reflect the multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-lingual society of India.

Indian Americans are represented in many fields including academics and entrepreneurs, doctors and lawyers, engineers and financiers.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Indian American median family income is $60,093 as against the national median family income of $38,885. The high income clearly reflects the advanced educational levels achieved by the community.

More than 87% of Indians in America have completed high school while at least 62% have some college education. As much as 58% of Indian Americans over the age of 25 hold a bachelor's degree or higher.

High levels of education have also enabled Indian Americans to become a productive segment of the U. S. population, with 72.3% participating in the work force.

Of these work force participants, 43.6% are employed in managerial and professional specialties.

Technical, sales, and administrative support occupations constitute another 33.2% of the work force.

The remaining 23.3% of the population works in other areas, such as operators, fabricators, laborers and precision production.

More than 5,000 Indian Americans today serve as faculty members in institutions of higher education in the U. S.

About 300,000 Indian Americans work in technology firms in California's Silicon Valley. They account for more than 15% of high-tech startups in that region. The average income of Indian Americans in that region is estimated to be $200,000 a year.

Two Indian Americans — late Har Gobind Khorana of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and late Subrahmanyan Chandrashekhar of University of Chicago — have been awarded the Nobel Prize, in medicine and physics respectively.

In deed, the NASA's premier X-ray observatory was named the Chandra X-ray Observatory in honor of the late Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Known to the world as Chandra, he was widely regarded as one of the foremost astrophysicists of the twentieth century. The observatory was launched into space in July, 1999.

Dr. Kalpana Chawla added a new chapter to the history of the Indian American community. In 1997, she became the first Indian or Indian American to fly in the U.S. space shuttle. She was part of the Space Shuttle Columbia Flight STS-87.

The estimated annual buying power of Indian Americans in the United States is around $20 billion.

Indian Americans are increasingly beginning to take a more direct role in political activities. They have traditionally exercised the most political influence through their campaign contributions, and are actively involved in fundraising efforts for political candidates on the federal, state and local levels.

As a result of these activities, together with the growing commercial interest in investment in India, the India caucus in the House of Representatives now numbers 118."
/teamspace/studios/this_studio/train/india_news_p000072.jpg,"India-U.S. Sign a Joint Statement on Cooperation in Energy and Environment

Minister of External Affairs Jaswant Singh and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed a joint statement on cooperation on energy and environment issues on behalf of the India and the United States on March 22, 2000 in Agra. The statement outlines a common agenda on clean energy development and environmental protection, including:

- Two ambitious national Indian environmental goals:
  - 10% of new electric power will come from renewable energy sources by 2011;
  - and approximately 15% improvements in energy efficiency in power production will be made by 2007-08.

Creation of a binational Joint Consultative Group on Clean Energy and the Environment that will focus on clean energy projects and policy, commercial development of clean energy, and enhanced cooperation on global climate change;

Promotion of a shared vision that countries can achieve robust economic growth while protecting the environment and taking action to combat climate change;

A reaffirmation of the urgent need for international dialogue on ways both developed and developing countries can participate in actions to combat climate change, consistent with treaty obligations under the Framework Convention on Climate Change;

Agreement to work in closer partnership on the further elaboration of mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, such as the Clean Development Mechanism; and acknowledgement of the essential role of the private sector and reference to new initiatives.

South Asia Regional Initiative (SARI) Energy Program:

The SARI Energy Program is a new $50 million USAID program designed to accelerate investment and trade in clean energy among South Asian nations, including India, Bangladesh and Nepal, which the President announced in Bangladesh on Monday. Program support will help countries foster regional cooperation and develop the appropriate policy, regulatory, and investment environments to encourage private investment. The program will promote the use of clean energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help stimulate economic growth.

U.S. Export-Import Bank Line of Credit:

The Ex-Im Bank will provide a $200 million specialized line of credit targeted for clean energy development projects through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Indian Power Finance Corporation.

Clean Energy Trade Mission:

To further the goals of President Clinton’s International Clean Energy initiative, the Department of Commerce will lead a trade mission to India focused on clean energy projects by the end of the year.

Greenhouse Gas Pollution Prevention Project (GEP):

USAID will provide $20 million for a three-year extension of this program to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency and cleaner fuel use. GEP will:

- expand the efforts of India’s National Thermal Power Corporation to increase efficiency in its power generation plants;
- help increase use of clean energy technology in power production;
- build local institutional capacity, and increase public/private partnerships for climate change abatement efforts; and
- design and demonstrate climate change abatement initiatives in cities.

Energy Conservation and Commercialization (ECO) Project:

USAID will provide $25 million for ECO, a program to help promote commercialization of energy efficient technologies and services. ECO will provide technical assistance and training to the Ministry of Power, electric utilities, and regulatory commissions on policy reforms and will work to address market constraints to greater use of energy efficiency products and services.

Resumption of Bilateral Energy Consultations and Technical Assistance:

Dept. of Energy will resume its cooperative efforts on non-nuclear power sector policy reforms, and on public and private collaborative projects related to clean energy, renewable energy and energy efficiency. DOE programs were suspended in 1998 in the context of policy-based restrictions on U.S. assistance to India.

Resumption of EPA Technical Assistance:

EPA will re-establish its environmental cooperation program in India with proposals to address air quality management, strengthening implementation of environmental policies and regulations, risk assessment and management of priority pollutants, and greenhouse gas reduction projects. EPA programs were suspended in 1998 in the context of policy-based restrictions on U.S. assistance to India.

Joint Private Sector Statement:

The Confederation on Indian Industry and the U.S. Energy Association announced a joint statement to cooperate on trade and investment for clean energy development in India. The parties announced creation of a new ‘green business center’ in Hyderabad and a ‘matchmaker’ initiative to help bring investors in contact with business/project opportunities."
